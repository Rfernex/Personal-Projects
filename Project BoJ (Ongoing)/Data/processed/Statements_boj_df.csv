The Bank of Japan will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to move on average around 0.25%.
Regardless of the above guideline for the call rate, the Bank of Japan will provide more ample funds, if judged necessary, to maintain the stability of the financial markets. (2) The overall economic condition of Japan has been deteriorating, and prices on a downward trend.Private bank lending has been declining, and the growth of money supply rather moderate.The money and capital markets have shown unstable developments, such as those seen in the risk premium on interest rates and stock prices.
The pace of further deterioration of the economy is expected to gradually slow down by the implementation of the government's fiscal policy measures including the comprehensive economic package.However, the level of economic activity has already declined considerably.In addition, there is a risk that recent developments in the financial markets and the increase in bankruptcy might further weaken the confidence of corporate and household sectors.Bearing these in mind, we cannot entirely preclude the possibility that economic and price conditions will worsen more. (3) The monetary policy objective of the Bank of Japan is to pursue price stability, avoiding both inflation and deflation.Taking into account the present economic and financial conditions, the Bank of Japan decided that the above-mentioned monetary easing measures be appropriate in order to prevent the economy from falling into a deflationary spiral and to ensure the slowdown of economic deterioration. (4) The Bank of Japan, through continued injection of ample funds under the above-mentioned policy guideline, will make every effort to keep the stability of the financial markets, thereby accommodating the expansion of money supply. (5) At present, recovery of business conditions and revitalization of the financial system are the imminent issues in the Japanese economy.The Bank of Japan strongly hopes that the decision to make money market operations more accommodative will facilitate the resolution of these issues and that all parties concerned will make their utmost efforts in surmounting the economic difficulties they face.

By majority vote, the Policy Board determined to ease further the stance of money market operations for the inter-meeting period ahead as follows: The Bank of Japan will provide more ample funds and encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to move as low as possible.
To avoid excessive volatility in the short-term financial markets, the Bank of Japan will, by paying due consideration to maintaining market function, initially aim to guide the above call rate to move around 0.15%, and subsequently induce further decline in view of the market developments. (2) The pace of deterioration of Japan's economy is moderating, mainly due to the increase in public investment. As the implementation of the government's economic stimulus gains pace, deterioration of the economy is expected to slowdown gradually. However, corporate and household sentiments remain cautious and private sector activities stagnant. Prices are on a downward trend. Clear prospects for rebound of the economy have yet to emerge.
With respect to financial developments, tight conditions once observed in inter-bank transactions and corporate funding have subsided. However, long-term interest rates have risen considerably, and the yen has been appreciating against the dollar. Stock prices, on the whole, have been weak. Such market developments could have an adverse impact on the future prospect of our economy. (3) Taking into account current economic and financial conditions, the Bank of Japan has judged it appropriate to provide, through monetary policy operations, an utmost support for the economic activities in order to avoid possible intensification of deflationary pressure and to ensure that the economic downturn will come to a halt. (4) The Bank of Japan, through more injections of ample funds under the above-mentioned policy guideline, will encourage the expansion of money supply and make every effort to maintain the stability in financial markets. (5) In conducting actual money market operations, the Bank of Japan will attempt to provide more ample liquidity through existing short-term operational instruments, paying due attention to the maintenance of the successful functioning of the short-term financial markets. The Bank of Japan, in particular, intends to actively utilize government bonds repo operations, which provide short-term liquidity in exchange for government bonds.
With respect to outright purchase of long-term government bonds, the Bank of Japan will continue to maintain the current frequency and amount. (6) In order to bring Japanese economy back to a solid recovery path, it is important not only to provide support from monetary and fiscal sides but also to steadily promote financial system revitalization and structural reforms. The Bank of Japan strongly hopes that the decision to make money market operations more accommodative will, combined with various efforts made by the parties concerned, contribute to surmounting the economic difficulties we face.

"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/mpr_1999/k990921a.htm","Bank of Japan At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Bank of Japan decided to continue the zero interest rate policy. The contents of discussions during Monetary Policy Meetings are usually published approximately one month after each Meeting as ""Minutes."" However, in view of the fact that the conduct of monetary policy has attracted unusually high attention, both domestically and overseas, against the backdrop of such developments as the rapid and large fluctuation in the foreign exchange rate, we considered it appropriate to explain the main points of contention in today's discussion immediately after the meeting. (Zero interest rate policy and quantitative easing) Since the launch of the zero interest rate policy in February, the Bank has continued to provide the financial market with ample funds to guide the overnight call rate as low as possible, currently at virtually zero percent, as exhibited by the following:
To keep the call rate at virtually zero percent in a stable manner, the Bank is continuing to provide funds in the amount of some 1 trillion yen more than the required reserve (on average about 4 trillion yen daily). However, since sentiment has permeated among financial institutions that they can always obtain almost cost-free funds, the incentive to hold funds has diminished. As a result, 70 to 80 percent of excess funds provided by the Bank is accumulating at such institutions as Tanshi companies (fund brokers).
Even when the Bank tries to provide almost cost-free funds through its open market operations, there are cases where actual subscription by financial institutions falls short of the announced amount. To keep the call rate at virtually zero percent in a stable manner, the Bank is continuing to provide funds in the amount of some 1 trillion yen more than the required reserve (on average about 4 trillion yen daily). However, since sentiment has permeated among financial institutions that they can always obtain almost cost-free funds, the incentive to hold funds has diminished. As a result, 70 to 80 percent of excess funds provided by the Bank is accumulating at such institutions as Tanshi companies (fund brokers). Even when the Bank tries to provide almost cost-free funds through its open market operations, there are cases where actual subscription by financial institutions falls short of the announced amount. (Effects of providing additional funds) Recently we have heard some arguments that the Bank should provide more ample funds in order to stabilize the foreign exchange rate. However, given the current financial market situations, any additional injection of liquidity would only result in further accumulation of excess funds at institutions such as Tanshi companies. In such a situation, it is difficult to envisage any visible effects on interest rates, the behavior of financial institutions and non-financial institutions, and asset prices including the foreign exchange rate. There is a view that the Bank should take advantage of the market's perception that ""additional fund provision"" would work. However, material effects are not likely expected and at best temporary, if any. Furthermore, we as a central bank will not take a measure that is not accountable with regard to its purpose and effects. (Foreign exchange rate and monetary policy) The Bank believes it desirable that the foreign exchange rate should move in a stable fashion reflecting economic fundamentals. Excessive volatility is very likely to have an adverse impact on the economy and prices. The recent appreciation of the yen has been too rapid and its effects on corporate profits, among other things, is a matter of concern. We believe this view is shared with the government. The foreign exchange rate in itself is not a direct objective of monetary policy. One of the precious lessons we learned from the experience of policy operations during the bubble period is that, monetary policy operations linked with control of the foreign exchange rate runs a risk of leading to erroneous policy decisions. Having said this, it does not mean that monetary policy is pursued without any consideration to the development of the foreign exchange rate. The Bank considers it important to carefully monitor the development of the foreign exchange rate from the viewpoint of how it affects the economy and prices. Since the recent appreciation of the yen has been rapid, we should carefully monitor its adverse impact on corporate profits, exports, and the overall economy. At the same time, however, we are seeing some signs of positive developments such as emerging effects of various policy measures already taken and the recovery of Asian economies. We believe that we are now at a stage to carefully focus attention on what effects these various factors exert on the economy. In relation to the foreign exchange rate policy, we have heard arguments in favor of non-sterilized intervention. In the reserve market, however, there are various flows of funds such as currency in circulation and Treasury funds other than those resulting from the intervention. The Bank conducts its daily market operations taking into account all the money flows, in order to create ample reserves to such an extent as described above. This strong commitment of fund provision is consistent with the government's current foreign exchange rate policy. (Monetary policy for the periods ahead) The Bank of Japan has been pursuing an unprecedented accommodative monetary policy and is explicitly committed to continue this policy until deflationary concerns subside. The Bank views the current state of the Japanese economy as having stopped deteriorating with some bright signs, though a clear and sustainable recovery of private demand has yet to be seen. In pursuing the zero interest rate policy, we need to carefully examine its adverse side-effects, but deem it important to support the economic recovery by continuing easy monetary policy for the periods ahead. In the past few days, the market has substantially fluctuated by speculations on monetary policy. What should be clear is that the conduct of monetary policy is exclusively decided by majority vote at the Monetary Policy Meeting, a regular meeting of the Policy Board. It is never the case that our policy is determined in advance or in consultation with outside bodies. We would like to emphasize this point. The Bank will continuously endeavor to explain the policy decision-making framework under the new Bank of Japan Law and the thinking behind the conduct of monetary policy.",1999-09-21,"1999-09"

In conducting money market operations, the Bank will respond flexibly such as by providing ample funds over the year-end, paying due consideration to fund demand related to Year 2000 problems. 2. As for Year 2000-related liquidity problems at individual financial institutions, the Bank of Japan intends to respond in a timely and appropriate manner through its lending in case an institution experiences a temporary liquidity shortage, taking into account such factors as the institution's soundness and availability of eligible collateral, although self-efforts on the part of individual institutions are a prerequisite in overcoming possible problems. In connection with the above, the Bank will accept requests from lending counterparties to submit eligible collateral to the Bank in advance. Taking into account such factors as funding prospects during the days covering the year change period and the amount of collateral necessary for market transactions, lending counterparties are advised to examine the necessity of submitting eligible collateral as well as the amount to submit, and to contact the Bank promptly if necessary.

The Bank of Japan will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to move on average around 0.25%. In February 1999, the Bank of Japan adopted the zero interest rate policy, unprecedented both in and out of Japan, to counter the possibility of mounting deflationary pressure and prevent further deterioration in economic conditions.Furthermore, it announced in April 1999 to continue the zero interest rate policy until deflationary concern is dispelled. Over the past one year and a half, Japan's economy has substantially improved, due to such factors as support from macroeconomic policy, recovery of the world economy, diminishing concerns over the financial system, and technological innovation in the broad information and communications area.At present, Japan's economy is showing clearer signs of recovery, and this gradual upturn, led mainly by business fixed investment, is likely to continue.Under such circumstances, the downward pressure on prices stemming from weak demand has markedly receded.
Considering these developments, the Bank of Japan feels confident that Japan's economy has reached the stage where deflationary concern has been dispelled, the condition for lifting the zero interest rate policy. Since the middle of this July, the Bank of Japan has been closely monitoring the possible impact the collapse of Sogo Department Store might have.So far, it has not triggered any significant spread of concern over the financial system, nor induced any notable deterioration in market sentiment. Today's decision signifies a small adjustment to the degree of monetary easing in line with the improvement of the economy, thereby contributing to long-term sustainable growth.
Even after the zero interest rate policy is terminated, monetary conditions remain largely relaxed in that the unsecured overnight call rate is still extremely low around 0.25%.The Bank of Japan will conduct monetary policy in an appropriate and flexible manner to support the economic recovery consistent with price stability.

"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/mpr_2001/k010319a.htm","Bank of Japan (For immediate release) Japan's economic recovery has recently come to a pause after it slowed in late 2000 under the influence of a sharp downturn of the global economy.Prices have been showing weak developments and there is concern about increase in downward pressures on prices stemming from weak demand. In retrospect, both monetary and fiscal policies have taken considerably strong actions during the past decade in Japan.Whereas fiscal policy has repeatedly implemented expansionary measures, the Bank of Japan has adopted a policy of maintaining interest rates at levels unprecedentedly low during the history of central banking at home and abroad, thereby providing ample liquidity.All this notwithstanding, Japan's economy has failed to return to a sustainable growth path, and is now faced again with a threat of deterioration. In light of this, the Bank has come to a conclusion that the economic conditions warrant monetary easing as drastic as is unlikely to be taken under ordinary circumstances.Accordingly, the Bank decided at its Monetary Policy Meeting of today to take the following policy actions.
a) Change in the operating target for money market operations
The main operating target for money market operations be changed from the current uncollateralized overnight call rate to the outstanding balance of the current accounts at the Bank of Japan.Under the new procedures, the Bank provides ample liquidity, and the uncollateralized overnight call rate will be determined in the market at a certain level below the ceiling set by the Lombard-type lending facility.
b) CPI guideline for the duration of the new procedures
The new procedures for money market operations continue to be in place until the consumer price index (excluding perishables, on a nationwide statistics) registers stably a zero percent or an increase year on year.
c) Increase in the current-account balance at the Bank of Japan and declines in interest rates
For the time being, the balance outstanding at the Bank's current accounts be increased to around 5 trillion yen, or 1 trillion yen increase from the average outstanding of 4 trillion yen in February 2001 (see Attachment).As a consequence, it is anticipated that the uncollateralized overnight call rate will significantly decline from the current target level of 0.15 percent and stay close to zero percent under normal circumstances.
d) ncrease in outright purchase of long-term government bonds
The Bank will increase the amount of its outright purchase of long-term government bonds from the current 400 billion yen per month, in case it considers that increase to be necessary for providing liquidity smoothly.The outright purchase is, on the other hand, subject to the limitation that the outstanding amount of long-term government bonds effectively held by the Bank, i.e., after taking account of the government bond sales under gensaki repurchase agreements, be kept below the outstanding balance of banknotes issued. a) Change in the operating target for money market operations

The Bank of Japan has decided to implement these policy measures with firm determination with a view to preventing prices from declining continuously as well as preparing a basis for sustainable economic growth. In order to make this monetary easing fully effective in restoring Japan's economy on a sustainable growth path, progress in structural reforms with respect to the financial system, e.g., resolution of the non-performing asset problem, as well as in the area of economy and industry is essential.Structural reform may be accompanied by painful adjustments.Without such adjustments, however, neither improvement in productivity nor sustainable economic growth can be obtained.The Bank of Japan strongly hopes that decisive actions be taken to address fundamental problems both with a clear support of the nation for structural reform and under a strong leadership of the government of Japan.

"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/mpr_2001/k010319c.htm","Bank of Japan Q1:Please explain the new procedures in which the outstanding balance of the current accounts at the BOJ is set as a main target for money market operations. A1:The Bank has conducted money market operations based on the guidelines set by the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Policy Board in terms of the uncollateralized overnight call rate.In the new procedures, the Monetary Policy Meeting will decide the guidelines in terms of the ""outstanding balance"" of the current accounts at the BOJ and operations will be conducted to meet the target balance. Q2:What is its impact on interest rates? A2:So far, the overnight call rate has stayed around 0.15% with around 4 trillion yen of the current account balance.As the outstanding balance of the current accounts will be raised to 5 trillion yen for the time being, the overnight call rate is expected to decline to stay around zero percent under normal circumstances.Furthermore, as market participants expect the procedures to last until ""the CPI (excluding perishables) registers stably a zero percent or an increase year on year,"" we can also expect a decline in interest rates across the yield curve (commitment effect). Q3:Is this a return to the ""Zero Interest Rate Policy""? A3:Under the ""Zero Interest Rate Policy,"" the Bank adjusted the amount of fund provision to guide a call rate close to zero.In the new procedures, the Bank sets the amount of fund provision as a main target and let market forces decide a call rate.Although interest rates are expected to stay around zero under normal circumstances with 5 trillion yen of the current account balance, they could somewhat rise when the market tightens and could reflect a certain difference in a credit risk.As such, the new procedures intend to achieve the same monetary easing effect of the ""Zero Interest Rate Policy"" while preserving a market mechanism as much as possible. Q4:More fluctuation in call rates is expected? A4:No. Thanks to the ""Lombard-Type"" lending facility introduced in this February, the official discount rate (0.25%) will set a ceiling, beyond which a call rate will not rise. Q5:Why was monetary base not chosen as a target? A5:Monetary base consists of the ""current account balance at the BOJ"" and ""cash in circulation"". In a short run, it is difficult for the Bank to effectively control the amount of cash, which accounts for 90 percent of monetary base, because it is determined by the demand from households and companies.In the case of the current account balance at the BOJ, the Bank has better control through daily market operations.If we assume a recent growth rate of bank notes (6% annually), it is expected that, by increasing the current account balance to 5 trillion yen, the growth rate of monetary base will rise from the current level (around 3% in February) to 7% within six months. Q6:The Bank has long opposed to the idea of increasing the outright purchase of the long-term government bonds.Has the policy changed? A6:No.In the new procedures, we decided to allow an increase in the outright purchase only in the case when such an increase is necessary for providing funds smoothly to meet the target current account balance, e.g. when we repeatedly fail to get enough bids for money market operations.The Bank still has no intentions to increase the amount of outright purchase of the long-term government bonds for the purpose of supporting bond prices or government financing.In order to make this point clear, the Bank continues its policy to control the amount of outright purchase of the long-term government bonds with reference to the bank note issuance by establishing a new ceiling on a stock basis. Q7:Does it mean that the Bank has adopted inflation targeting? A7:Inflation targeting is usually defined as a scheme under which 1) a desirable inflation rate from a long-term perspective is set as a target and 2) a central bank adjusts monetary policy in a forward-looking manner when an actual inflation rate is expected to deviate from the target.The Bank's policy on inflation targeting is that we have to further examine its desirability and feasibility because it is difficult to numerically define a desirable inflation rate from a long-term perspective in the current situation in Japan.This time, the Bank committed itself that this unorthodox policy will be continued until the actual CPI registers a zero percent or an increase year on year.Although it is not inflation targeting, it shows the Bank's determination to prevent a continuous price decline and to form a basis for a sustainable growth.",2001-03-19,"2001-03"

Economic adjustments are deepening as industrial production is sharply declining due to a fall in exports.Risks are increasing for the adjustments to spread to wider areas as falling production is expected to cause an associated decline in domestic demand.Recent capital market developments at home and abroad may also adversely affect the real economy.A weaker demand could intensify downward pressure on prices in the coming period. Earlier this year, the Bank has taken monetary easing measures unprecedented in the history of central banking, with firm determination to prevent a continuous decline in prices and to form a basis for sustainable economic growth.Consequently, ample liquidity has been provided to financial markets and interest rates have declined to extremely low levels.
However, given the adverse recent and prospective developments regarding growth and prices, the Bank considered it appropriate and necessary to further strengthen monetary support for economic recovery under the new framework established in March. The Bank will continue to make every effort as a central bank to support Japan's economy so that it could return to a stable and sustainable growth path. However, given economic developments worldwide and the seriousness of confronting problems, it is not an easy task to revitalize Japan's economy.Progress in structural reforms is indispensable for monetary easing to exert its full potential, which would help restore Japan's economy to a stable and sustainable growth path. In this regard, it is encouraging that concrete steps for reforms have started to take place under the strong leadership of the government.A series of monetary easing measures, including today's decision, is consistent with providing maximum support for such reform efforts in various areas.The Bank of Japan strongly hopes that the government and the private sector will make further steady progress in structural reforms, while overcoming associated short-term pains.

In response to a surge in demand for liquidity caused by the terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, the Bank has taken every necessary measure, including a significant increase in the outstanding balance of current accounts held at the Bank exceeding eight trillion yen, in order to ensure smooth fund settlement and proper functioning of financial markets. In financial markets at home and abroad, disruption in transactions and settlements has so far been successfully avoided, reflecting ample liquidity provision by major central banks as well as appropriate responses by market participants.However, it is still necessary to carefully monitor the effect of the incident on global financial markets and economic activities.Should any event hamper smooth fund settlement or the functioning of financial markets, it could interrupt the permeation of monetary easing effects stemming from the policy measures taken so far. Against this background, the Bank found it appropriate to take the above measures in order to secure proper functioning of financial markets and to enhance the effective permeation of monetary easing effects. As the Bank has repeatedly stressed, in order to make monetary easing more effective and to bring Japan's economy back to a stable and sustainable growth path, it is indispensable that progress is made in the area of structural reforms with respect to the financial system as well as the economy and industry.From this viewpoint, the Bank strongly hopes that steady progress in structural reforms will continue overcoming the effect of the recent tragedy in the United States and various pains associated with structural reforms. The Bank will continue to make every effort as a central bank to prevent a continuous decline in prices and to establish a basis for the stable and sustainable growth of Japan's economy, including efforts to cope with the non-performing loan problem.

Japan's economy is deteriorating broadly and likely to undergo a severe adjustment phase for the time being.Against this background, looking at the stock market as well as the markets for commercial paper and corporate bonds, price differentials are widening reflecting the credit conditions of each firm.As such, financial institutions and investors are becoming more cautious. To some extent, this deterioration in the financial environment is the inevitable process associated with structural reform in the area of economy and industry as well as the restoration of a robust and sound financial system.Nevertheless, there is concern that, if the deterioration in the financial environment goes too far and adversely affects financing by firms in good condition, it could exert downward pressure on economic activity and prices. With these points in mind, today's decision is intended to secure that the financial markets continue to work in a stable manner and to ensure that economic recovery will be effectively supported from the monetary side. While carefully monitoring developments in economic activity as well as financial markets, the Bank will continue to make every effort as a central bank to prevent a continuous decline in prices and to establish a basis for the stable and sustainable growth of Japan's economy.

"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/mpr_2002/k020228.htm","Bank of Japan (For immediate release) As a result of strong monetary easing by the Bank of Japan, extremely accommodative conditions are being maintained in the financial markets. Short-term interest rates have declined to virtually zero percent while the year-on-year growth rate of monetary base has reached nearly 30 percent. With the end of a fiscal year approaching, however, there is a possibility that liquidity demand will increase further depending on the financial market developments. It is thus extremely important to take all possible measures to secure the financial market stability in order to prevent a deflationary spiral and to pursue a sustainable economic growth. Against this background, the Bank has decided to take the following measures.
1) Providing ample liquidity towards the end of a fiscal year
For the time being, to secure the financial market stability towards the end of a fiscal year, the Bank will provide more liquidity to meet a surge in demand irrespective of the target of current account balances, around 10 to 15 trillion yen (attachment).
2) Increasing the outright purchase of long-term government bonds
In order to provide liquidity smoothly, the Bank will increase the outright purchase of long-term government bonds from the current 800 billion yen per month (or 9. 6 trillion yen per year) to 1 trillion yen per month (or 12 trillion yen per year).
3) Easing the restriction on the use of the Lombard-type lending facility
In the period starting March 1st and ending April 15th, the end of the March reserve maintenance period, the Bank will apply the official discount rate to the Lombard-type lending facility on any business day, suspending the current restriction on the maximum number of days for such use, namely five business days in a reserve maintenance period.
4) Examining issues to broaden the range of eligible collateral
The Bank will immediately examine operational issues to broaden the range of eligible collateral to include loans to the Deposit Insurance Corporation as well as loans to the Government's ""Special Account for the Allotment of Local Allocation Tax and Local Transfer Tax. ""In the process, the Bank will consult with concerned parties to take necessary steps including those for making such loans negotiable. 1) Providing ample liquidity towards the end of a fiscal year

To realize the full permeation of the effects of strong monetary easing, it is essential to strengthen a financial system and ensure its stability by making a swift move to resolve the non-performing loan problem. It is also vital to make progress in structural reform on the economic and industrial fronts through tax reform, streamlining of public financial institutions, and deregulation. The Bank strongly hopes that both the Government and the private sector, in particular financial institutions, will take more determined and effective steps in this regard. The recent price decline reflects the widening output gap in the economy as well as the effects of structural changes in the supply-side including a rise in the import penetration ratio. In order to exit from deflation, it is indispensable to revitalize economic activity and to bring the economy back to a sustainable growth path through decisive steps including those described in paragraph 4.

It should be noted, however, that stock prices in Japan, as in major markets abroad, have been volatile reflecting growing concern over global economic prospects. A stock price decline could affect expenditures by the corporate and household sectors through various channels. Moreover, given the current economic and financial situation, it could threaten the stability of financial markets and the financial system.

Japan's economy has stopped deteriorating but has not yet shown clear signs of recovery. Against this backdrop, prospects for the economy have been facing increasing uncertainties, including global economic developments and the impact of likely acceleration in the pace of dealing with the non-performing loan (NPL) problem. In addition, stock prices have been volatile both in domestic and overseas markets. In financial markets, ample liquidity provided by the Bank continues to restrain financial institutions' concern over liquidity financing. However, against the background of the above mentioned stock price developments as well as uncertainties regarding the resolution of the NPL problem, the short-term money market is experiencing some instability as evidenced by a modest rise in interest rates. In addition, the lending attitude of financial institutions could tighten in the coming period. Based on the above assessment regarding the current economic and financial situation as well as its future prospects, the Bank thought it appropriate to take best measures to maintain the smooth functioning and stability of financial markets, thereby strengthening support for economic recovery from the monetary side. In order to ensure the abundant liquidity provision by the Bank leading to the revitalization of the economy, improvement in credit allocation function of capital markets is important in addition to the strengthening of the financial intermediary function of banks. In this regard, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of expected government measures to accelerate the resolution of the NPL problem on corporate financing and explore possible measures to secure the smooth working of corporate financing. The Bank will continue to make every effort as a central bank, including measures to secure financial system stability, in order to establish a basis for the stable and sustainable growth of Japan's economy and, thereby, prevent a continuous decline in prices.

Given the prevailing severe economic and financial conditions including the effects of military action against Iraq, the Bank decided to further examine the basic framework for the conduct of monetary policy. As input to the process of discussing the basic framework, the Chairman instructed Bank staff to examine a wide range of issues related to the enhancement of monetary policy transparency and the strengthening of the monetary policy transmission mechanism based on the experience of quantitative easing so far and report back to the next MPM.
With respect to specific measures, the Chairman particularly instructed Bank staff to explore possible measures to strengthen the transmission mechanism of monetary easing in the areas of corporate finance and money market operations and report back to the MPM as soon as possible.

The Bank of Japan is currently committed to maintaining the quantitative easing policy until the consumer price index (excluding fresh food, on a nationwide basis) registers stably a zero percent or an increase year on year.The Bank emphasizes that it is firmly committed to this policy at this juncture where there are signs of improvement in the Japanese economy.Today, the Bank decided to take the following measures at the Monetary Policy Meeting.These measures will contribute to further ensuring the recent movement toward an economic recovery from the monetary policy front.
(1) Increase in the upper limit of the target balance of current accounts
The Bank raised the upper limit of the target balance of current accounts from around 30 trillion yen to around 32 trillion yen.The new target balance is 'around 27 to 32 trillion yen.'(see Attachment)This action was taken in light of making room for conducting monetary operations in a more flexible manner.

(3) Enhancement of monetary policy transparency
With the aim of enhancing the transparency of monetary policy, the Bank will make available more detailed description of the commitment to maintaining the quantitative easing policy, and improving the way in which the Bank's evaluation of the developments of the economy and prices is communicated (see ""Enhancement of Monetary Policy Transparency"").

"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/mpr_2006/k060309.htm","Bank of Japan (For immediate release) Change in the Guideline for Money Market Operations At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Bank of Japan decided to change the operating target of money market operations from the outstanding balance of current accounts at the Bank to the uncollateralized overnight call rate, and to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period (see Attachment). The Bank of Japan will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at effectively zero percent. Measures concerning Money Market Operations The outstanding balance of current accounts at the Bank of Japan will be reduced towards a level in line with required reserves. Given that financial institutions have managed liquidity against the backdrop of large amounts of current account balances and extensive funds-supplying operations by the Bank for a prolonged period since the adoption of the quantitative easing policy, the reduction in current account balance is expected to be carried out over a period of a few months, taking full account of conditions in the short-term money market. The process will be managed through short-term money market operations. With respect to the outright purchases of long-term interest-bearing Japanese government bonds, purchases will continue at the current amounts and frequency for some time, with due regard for future conditions of the balance sheet of the Bank. With respect to the complementary lending facility, the loan rate will remain at the current level. The temporary waiver of add-on rates for frequent users of the facility, in effect since March 2003, will also be maintained. The Bank's View on Economic Activity and Prices Since March 2001, in view of preventing sustained decline in prices and preparing the basis for sustainable growth, the Bank of Japan has supplied extremely ample liquidity with current account balance at the Bank as the main operating target. The Bank also made a clear commitment to maintain the policy until the consumer price index (excluding fresh food, on a nationwide basis) registers stably zero percent or an increase year on year. The Bank has since maintained the quantitative easing policy according to this commitment. Currently, Japan's economy continues to recover steadily. Exports have continued to increase reflecting the expansion of overseas economies. With respect to domestic private demand, business fixed investment has also continued to increase against the backdrop of high corporate profits. Robust corporate activity is positively influencing households, and private consumption has become solid. Looking ahead, the Bank expects a sustained recovery. Concerning prices, year-on-year changes in the consumer price index turned positive. Meanwhile, the output gap is gradually narrowing. Unit labor costs generally face weakening downward pressures as wages began to rise amid productivity gains. Furthermore, firms and households are shifting up their expectations for inflation. In this environment, year-on-year changes in the consumer price index are expected to remain positive. The Bank, therefore, judged that the conditions laid out in the commitment are fulfilled. Current View on Monetary Policy Given that the effects of the quantitative easing policy on economic activity and prices now mainly result from short-term interest rates being zero, there will be no abrupt change as a result of today's policy decision. Looking ahead, in considering the central scenario for economic activity and prices, there is a high probability of realizing sustainable growth under price stability. In the meantime, it should be noted that, over the medium- to long-term, there is a risk of swings in economic activity, as the stimulus from monetary policy is amplified against the backdrop of improving corporate profitability and a positive turn in price developments. On the future path of monetary policy, there will be a period in which the overnight call rate is at effectively zero percent, followed by a gradual adjustment in the light of developments in economic activity and prices. In this process, if the risk mentioned above remains muted, in other words, if it is judged that inflationary pressures are restrained as the economy follows a balanced and sustainable growth path, an accommodative monetary environment ensuing from very low interest rates will probably be maintained for some time.

Bank of Japan At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Bank of Japan decided, by 7-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period: The Bank of Japan will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at effectively zero percent.

"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/mpr_2006/k060309b.htm","Bank of Japan The Bank of Japan Law stipulates the principle of monetary policy as ""contributing to the sound development of the national economy"" ""through the pursuit of price stability."" Based on this principle, the Bank is pursuing an appropriate course of monetary policy. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Bank decided to introduce a new framework for the conduct of monetary policy, as well as to review its thinking on price stability. The Bank of Japan will review its basic thinking on price stability, and disclose a level of inflation rate that its Policy Board members currently understand as price stability from a medium- to long-term viewpoint, in their conduct of monetary policy (""an understanding of medium- to long-term price stability,"" see infra). Board members will conduct monetary policy in the light of such thinking and understanding. In deciding the conduct of monetary policy, the Bank of Japan will examine economic activity and prices from two perspectives explained below. The first perspective is examining, as regards economic activity and prices one to two years in the future, whether the outlook deemed most likely by the Bank of Japan follows a path of sustainable growth under price stability. The second perspective is examining, in a longer term, various risks that are most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy aimed at realizing sustainable growth under price stability. More specifically, for example, the Bank of Japan may examine risk factors that will significantly impact economic activity and prices when they materialize although the probability is low. The Bank of Japan will, in the light of deliberations from the two perspectives described above, outline the current view on monetary policy, and, as a rule, disclose it periodically in the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices. Price stability is a state where various economic agents including households and firms may make decisions regarding such economic activities as consumption and investments without being concerned about the fluctuations in the general price level. Price stability is an indispensable prerequisite for realizing sustainable growth, and the Bank of Japan is responsible for realizing price stability through an appropriate conduct of monetary policy. In this regard, given that the effects of monetary policy take time to work through the economy and that volatility of output may actually be amplified when attempts are made to absorb every short-term change in prices resulting from various shocks, the Bank strives to forecast developments in economic activity and prices from a sufficiently long-term viewpoint and to realize price stability over the medium to long term. The basic indicator for the evaluation of price developments is a price index that covers goods and services consumed by households and which the public at large is accustomed to. In particular, the consumer price index is important in the light of its favorable attributes including timeliness. Price stability is, conceptually, a state where the change in the price index without measurement bias is zero percent. Currently, there seems to be no significant bias in the Japanese consumer price index. If there is a risk of falling into a vicious cycle of declining prices and deteriorating economic activity, depending on the weight attached to the risk, the accommodation of slight inflation may be deemed consistent with an understanding of price stability in the conduct of monetary policy. In the case of Japan, the average rate of inflation over the last few decades is lower than major overseas economies. Japan has also experienced a prolonged period of low rates of inflation since the 1990s. Consequently, the rate of inflation at which households and firms perceive price stability seems to be low, and economic decisions may be guided by such a low inflation environment. The conduct of monetary policy must take account of such possibilities. In today's Monetary Policy Meeting, there was a discussion of the level of inflation rate that each Policy Board member currently understands as price stability from a medium- to long-term viewpoint, in the conduct of monetary policy (""an understanding of medium- to long-term price stability""). While there was a range of views, reflecting the differences in the relative weight attached to factors affecting the understanding of price stability, it was recognized that the level was somewhat lower than that in major overseas economies. It was agreed that, by making use of the rate of year-on-year change in the consumer price index to describe the understanding, an approximate range between zero and two percent was generally consistent with the distribution of each Board member's understanding of medium- to long-term price stability. Most Board members' median figures fell on both sides of one percent. Given that the understanding of medium- to long-term price stability may change gradually reflecting developments such as structural changes in the economy, as a rule, Board members will review it annually.

"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/mpr_2006/k060714.pdf"," Bank of Japan Change in the Guideline for Money Market Operations 1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Bank of Japan decided, by a unanimous vote, to change the guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period, effective immediately from the announcement of the decision. The Bank of Japan will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at around 0.25 percent. 2. With respect to the complementary lending facility, the Bank decided, by a 6-3 majority vote, to change the basic loan rate[Note] applicable under the facility to 0.4 percent, effective immediately from the announcement of the decision, and maintain the temporary waiver of add-on rates for frequent users of the facility. With respect to the outright purchases of long-term interest-bearing Japanese government bonds, purchases will continue at the current amounts and frequency for some time, with due regard for future conditions of the balance sheet of the Bank. 3. Japan's economy continues to expand moderately, with domestic and external demand and also the corporate and household sectors well in balance. The economy is likely to expand for a sustained period. Developments are broadly in line with the projection in the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (hereafter the Outlook Report) released on April 28, 2006. The year-on-year rate of change in consumer prices is projected to continue to follow a positive trend. [Note] The basic loan rate is stipulated in Article 15, Paragraph 1, Clause 2 of the Bank of Japan Law. The basic discount rate in Clause 1 in the same paragraph is also set at 0.4 percent (Discounting bills has been suspended). 1 4. The Bank has maintained zero interest rates for an extended period, and the stimulus from monetary policy has been gradually amplified against the backdrop of steady improvements in economic activity and prices. In this environment, maintaining the previous level of the policy interest rate may result in large swings in economic activity and prices in the future. Taking account of the current assessment of economic activity and prices from the two perspectives outlined in the New Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy (March 2006), the Bank judged it appropriate to adjust the level of the policy interest rate at this juncture so that a desirable course of economic activity and prices was to be maintained. Today’s policy decision will contribute to ensuring price stability and achieving sustainable growth in the medium to long term. 5. On the future path of monetary policy, the Bank will conduct monetary policy by carefully assessing economic activity and prices. The Bank will adjust the level of the policy interest rate gradually in the light of developments in economic activity and prices if they follow the projection presented in the Outlook Report. In this process, an accommodative monetary environment ensuing from very low interest rates will probably be maintained for some time. 2 ( Reference ) • ",2006-07-14,"2006-07"

Economic growth is slowing further reflecting weaker growth in business fixed investment and private consumption against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices. While growth will likely remain slow for the time being, it is expected to gradually return onto a moderate growth path thereafter. CPI inflation rate (excluding fresh food) is currently around 1.5 percent due to increased prices of petroleum products and food. CPI inflation is expected to gradually moderate after becoming somewhat elevated in coming months. These suggest that the possibility of the economy remaining on a sustainable growth path with price stability is relatively high. 3. Compared with the projections presented in the April Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report), growth prospects have shifted somewhat lower, while prospects for inflation, in terms of both CGPI and CPI (excluding fresh food), have shifted higher, mainly for fiscal 2008. 4. With regard to risk factors, global financial markets remain unstable and there are downside risks to the U.S. and the world economy. In addition, weaker income generation due to upsurge in commodity prices has the potential to weigh on domestic private demand. These downside risks to the economy demand attention. On prices, inflationary pressures are increasing globally. In Japan, it is necessary to be mindful of upside risks due to changes in the inflation expectations of households and the price-setting behavior of firms in addition to developments in energy and materials prices. Meanwhile, if the downside risks to the economy turn out to decrease, this will increase the risk of possible swings in economic activity and prices due to prolonged period of accommodative financial conditions. 5.

Adjustments in the world economy stemming from financial crises in the United States and Europe have further increased in severity. Under these circumstances, increased sluggishness in Japan's economic activity will likely remain over the next several quarters with exports leveling off and the effects of earlier increases in energy and materials prices persisting. As for prices, consumer price inflation is likely to decline gradually reflecting the recent fall in commodity prices, although it remains relatively high to date. The outlook for economic activity and prices is attended by increased downside risks to economic activity but also by decreased upside risks to inflation relative to the recent past. 2. The Bank, while strains in global financial markets have mounted, has undertaken various prompt and decisive measures in providing liquidity, bearing in mind that the most important contribution a central bank can make in this situation is to ensure stability in financial markets. In addition, at the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Bank judged that a reduction in policy interest rates and a further increase in the flexibility of money market operations were necessary to maintain accommodative financial conditions. Respective decisions are as follows. (1) Change in the guideline for money market operations (decided by the chairman’s final decision after a split vote [Note 1]) Lower the Bank's target for the uncollateralized overnight call rate by 20 basis points and encourage it to remain at around 0.3 percent (effective immediately) (Attachment 1).

In the longer run, the economy is most likely to return onto a sustainable growth path with price stability. However, the outlook remains highly uncertain and given the slowdown in overseas economies and the turmoil in global financial markets, it will likely take some time for the necessary conditions for Japan's economic recovery to be satisfied. 3. With regard to risk factors, attention needs to be paid to the further downside risks to economic activity depending on financial conditions in the United States and Europe as well as developments in overseas economies. In addition, if financial conditions, as reflected in lending attitudes of financial institutions and issuing conditions in the corporate bond and CP markets, should increase in severity, pressures acting to depress economic activity from the financial side may become more marked. Turning to prices, upside risks have decreased compared with the past, while there is a possibility that the inflation rate will decline further if downside risks to economic activity materialize or commodity prices fall further. 4. The Bank will carefully assess the future outlook for economic activity and prices, closely considering the likelihood of its projections as well as factors posing upside or downside risks, and will implement monetary policy appropriately. In addition, the Bank, while monitoring developments in global financial markets, will continue to make efforts to ensure market stability by conducting appropriate money market operations such as the provision of sufficient funds over the year-end and the fiscal year-end. Given the aforementioned financial conditions, the Bank will carry out purchases of CP under repurchase agreements more flexibly to facilitate corporate financing. Also, in this regard, the Chairman has instructed Bank staff to swiftly examine and report at the Monetary Policy Meeting possible changes in the treatment of corporate debt as collateral, as well as possible ways to enhance flexibility in funds-supplying operations collateralized by corporate debt.

Financial conditions have become tighter. Under these circumstances, economic conditions have been deteriorating significantly and are likely to continue deteriorating for the time being. Meanwhile, CPI inflation (excluding fresh food) has recently moderated reflecting the declines in the prices of petroleum products and the stabilization of food prices, and will likely become negative by this spring with increasing slackness in supply and demand conditions. The Bank's baseline scenario through fiscal 2010 expects that, with the assumption of medium- to long-term growth expectations and inflation expectations remaining generally unchanged, the economy will, from the latter half of fiscal 2009, start recovering and price declines will abate as global financial markets regain stability and overseas economies move out of their deceleration phase.

Fund raising in financial markets for funds over the fiscal year-end has mostly been completed, but it is likely that the markets will remain under stress in the new fiscal year given the severe financial and economic conditions described below. In light of this situation, the Bank judged that continued provision of substantial liquidity is required to ensure stability in financial markets. To put this into action, the Bank decided to further utilize its long-term funds-supplying operations by increasing its outright purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs), thereby facilitating smooth money market operations.

Expand the range of eligible collateral for loans on deeds to the government and those with government guarantees b. Accept loans on deeds to municipal governments as eligible collateral 3. Exports have been decreasing substantially reflecting the deterioration in overseas economic conditions, and domestic demand has become weaker against the background of declining corporate profits and the worsening employment and income situation in the household sector. Financial conditions have remained tight on the whole, despite improvements in issuing conditions for CP and corporate bonds. Under these circumstances, economic conditions have deteriorated significantly. The pace of decline in exports and production is expected to moderate as inventory adjustments progress both at home and abroad, but economic conditions are likely to continue deteriorating for the time being due to a further weakening in domestic private demand.

The Bank, among other actions, had expanded the range of eligible collateral since last autumn to ensure stability in financial markets by further facilitating money market operations. In this process, the Bank, in coordination with other central banks, examined the feasibility of accepting the so-called cross-border collateral and decided today to accept bonds issued by the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France as eligible collateral (see ""Collateral Guidelines on Eligible Foreign Bonds""). 3.

While Japan's economy is picking up, there is not yet sufficient momentum to support self-sustaining recovery in business fixed investment and private consumption. As for the outlook, the pace of economic improvement is likely to remain moderate until around the middle of fiscal 2010. On the price front, downward pressures on prices are expected to remain even after the year-on-year decline in the CPI (excluding fresh food) becomes fairly moderate toward the beginning of next year.

Since the Tohoku Pacific Earthquake occurred, the Bank of Japan has been trying to gauge its effects on financial markets and financial institutions' business operations, as well as taking all possible measures in order to maintain financial intermediation function and secure smooth fund settlements. In addition, the Bank has been providing funds flexibly through appropriate money market operations. 2. Japan's economy is emerging from the current deceleration phase. The year-on-year rate of decline in the CPI (excluding fresh food) has continued to slow. The Bank has maintained its baseline scenario that Japan's economy is expected to return to a moderate recovery path. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to become slightly positive in the near future.1 However, the damage of the earthquake has been geographically widespread, and thus, for the time being, production is likely to decline and there is also concern that the sentiment of firms and households might deteriorate. 3. In recognition of the current situation, at the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided to take the following measures to further enhance monetary easing. (1) The Guideline for Money Market Operations for the Intermeeting Period The Policy Board decided, by a unanimous vote,2 to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period. Under this guideline, the Bank will provide ample funds sufficient to meet demand in financial markets and will do its utmost to ensure financial market stability.

Since the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred, the Bank, with a view to ensuring stability in financial markets, has been providing ample funds sufficient to meet demand in the markets. It further strengthened monetary easing by increasing the amount of the Asset Purchase Program, mainly of the purchases of risk assets, by about 5 trillion yen. In addition to such measures, at today's meeting, the Bank judged it necessary to introduce a funds-supplying operation that provides financial institutions in disaster areas with longer-term funds in order to support their initial response efforts to meet the future demand for funds for restoration and rebuilding. The Bank accordingly compiled a preliminary framework for the operation as in the Attachment. It also judged it appropriate to broaden the range of eligible collateral for money market operations with a view to securing sufficient financing capacity of financial institutions in disaster areas. The Chairman instructed the staff to examine the specifics of these two measures and report back at the next Monetary Policy Meeting. 3.

Japan's economy faces strong downward pressure, mainly on the production side, due to the effects of the earthquake disaster. Production has declined sharply due to the supply-side constraints caused by the disaster. As a result, exports have decreased substantially, and domestic private demand has also been weak partly affected by a deterioration in business and household sentiment. Meanwhile, financial conditions have generally continued to ease, although weakness has been observed in the financial positions of some firms, mainly small ones, since the earthquake.

The Bank of Japan conducts monetary policy based on the principle that the policy shall be aimed at ""achieving price stability, thereby, contributing to the sound development of the national economy."" In doing so, price stability must be the one sustainable in the medium to long term. 2. At today's Monetary Policy Meeting, the Policy Board of the Bank introduced ""the price stability goal in the medium to long term"" as a part of its efforts to further clarify the determination to overcome deflation and achieve sustainable growth with price stability. 3. ""The price stability goal in the medium to long term"" is the inflation rate that the Bank judges to be consistent with price stability sustainable in the medium to long term. The Bank judges that ""the price stability goal in the medium to long term"" is in a positive range of 2 percent or lower in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) and, more specifically, set a goal at 1 percent for the time being. Prior to today's introduction of the goal, the ""understanding of medium- to long-term price stability"" showed a range of inflation rates that each Policy Board member understood as price stability from a medium- to long-term viewpoint. 4. At today's meeting, the Board confirmed that the following elements of basic thinking about ""price stability"" agreed in the past, which form the basis of ""the price stability goal in the medium to long term,"" were still relevant. (1) Conceptual definition: ""Price stability"" is a state where economic agents such as households and firms may make decisions regarding economic activities without being concerned about the fluctuations in the general price level. (2) Time frame: Price stability should be pursued over the medium to long term by making economic and price forecasts from a sufficiently long-term viewpoint. (3) Main indicator: The basic indicator for the evaluation of price developments is a price index that covers goods and services consumed by households and which the public at large is accustomed to. In particular, the CPI is important in light of its favorable 1 attributes including timeliness. 5. In expressing ""the price stability goal in the medium to long term"" in specific inflation rates, following the exercise in the past reviews, the Board examined the rate from three perspectives: measurement bias in a price index; the safety margin that acts as a buffer against the risk of a vicious cycle of deflation and stagnation; and the rate of inflation at which households and firms perceive price stability, i.e. the general public's perception of price developments. It also deems necessary to consider high uncertainty surrounding the future developments such as structural changes in Japan's economy and global economic environment. For this reason, the Board decided to express ""the price stability goal in the medium to long term"" in specific inflation rates by making some allowances as ""a positive range of 2 percent or lower in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI."" Within this range, the Board decided to set a goal at 1 percent for the time being to clarify the inflation rate which the Bank's monetary policy aims to achieve. 6.

At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan made the following decisions. (1) The Bank publishes ""the price stability goal in the medium to long term"" as the inflation rate consistent with price stability sustainable in the medium to long term.1 The Bank judges ""the price stability goal in the medium to long term"" to be within a positive range of 2 percent or lower in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI and, more specifically, sets a goal at 1 percent for the time being. (2) For the time being, the Bank will pursue powerful monetary easing by conducting its virtually zero interest rate policy and by implementing the Asset Purchase Program mainly through the purchase of financial assets, with the aim of achieving the goal of 1 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI. The Bank will continue pursuing the powerful easing until it judges that the 1 percent goal is in sight on the condition that the Bank does not identify any significant risk, including the accumulation of financial imbalances, from the viewpoint of ensuring sustainable economic growth. (3) The Bank increases the total size of the Asset Purchase Program by about 10 trillion yen, from about 55 trillion yen to about 65 trillion yen. The increase in the Program is earmarked for the purchase of Japanese government bonds.2 By fully implementing the Program including the additional expansion decided today, by the end of 2012, the amount outstanding of the Program will be increased by about 22 trillion yen from the current level of around 43 trillion yen.3 2.

Japan's economy currently confronts the long-term structural challenge of declining trend growth rates amid rapid population aging. Tackling this challenge is crucial for establishing a new basis for economic growth. The goal of overcoming deflation will be achieved through such efforts to strengthen growth potential and via support from the financial side. With this in mind, it is important for business firms, financial institutions, the government, and the central bank each to continue exerting themselves in their respective roles. 2. Based on the above recognition, the Bank of Japan clarified its monetary policy stance and further enhanced monetary easing in February 2012. Subsequent to these decisions, at the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank decided to enhance the fund-provisioning measure to support strengthening the foundations for economic growth (hereafter referred to as ""the Growth-Supporting Funding Facility"") as followings. As a result of today's enhancement both in terms of the yen and a foreign currency, the total amount of loans available through the Growth-Supporting Funding Facility will increase by 2 trillion yen, from 3.5 trillion yen to 5.5 trillion yen. (1) The Bank decided to establish special rules for a new arrangement for loans of 500 billion yen for small-lot investments and loans that had not been deemed eligible in the main rules for the Growth-Supporting Funding Facility (see Attachment 1 for an outline of the new arrangement for small-lot investments and loans). (2) The Bank will establish special rules for a new arrangement for loans in the U.S. dollar of 1 trillion yen equivalent for investments and loans denominated in foreign currencies which should contribute to Japan's economic growth (see Attachment 2 for a preliminary outline of the new arrangement for loans in the U.S. dollar). The new loans will be made using the U.S. dollar reserves already held by the Bank. The chairman instructed 1 At today's meeting, Mr. Miyao proposed to increase the amount of the Asset Purchase Program by about 5 trillion yen, which would bring the total volume of the Program to about 70 trillion yen. The proposal was defeated by a majority vote. ",2012-03-13,"2012-03"

At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan made the following decisions, by a unanimous vote, regarding the Asset Purchase Program (hereafter referred to as ""the Program""). (1) The Bank decided to increase the total size of the Program by about 5 trillion yen, from about 65 trillion yen to about 70 trillion yen, with the following changes in its composition.1 (a) An increase in the purchase of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) by about 10 trillion yen (b) An increase in the purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) by about 200 billion yen and 10 billion yen, respectively (c) A reduction in the maximum outstanding amount of the Bank's fixed-rate funds-supplying operation against pooled collateral with a six-month term, by about 5 trillion yen, taking into account the recent episodes of undersubscription (2) With the aim of smoothly conducting the large-scale purchases after today's increase and encouraging a decline in longer-term interest rates effectively, the Bank decided to extend the remaining maturity of JGBs to be purchased under the Program from ""one to two years"" to ""one to three years."" It also decided to extend the remaining maturity of corporate bonds to be purchased under the Program just as is the case of JGBs. (3) The Bank decided to increase the outstanding amount of the Program to about 70 trillion yen by around end-June 2013, while maintaining the existing schedule of increasing the outstanding amount of the Program to about 65 trillion yen by around end-2012. 2. The Policy Board also decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period: The Bank of Japan will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at around 1 See Attachment for an overview of the Program. 1 0 to 0.1 percent. 3. Looking at economic developments overseas, a risk of the European debt problem causing financial market turmoil has decreased and the U.S. economy has continued to recover at a moderate pace. Against this background, although Japan's economic activity has remained more or less flat, it has become increasingly evident that the economy is shifting toward a pick-up phase as positive developments have become widespread. As examined in the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report) to be released today, Japan's economy is expected to return to a moderate recovery path as the pace of recovery in overseas economies picks up, led by emerging and commodity-exporting economies, and as reconstruction-related demand after the earthquake disaster gradually strengthens. As the aggregate supply and demand balance improves, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to gradually rise to a range of above 0.5 percent and less than 1 percent toward the latter half of the projection period in the Outlook Report. Thereafter, it will likely be not too long before the rate reaches the Bank's ""price stability goal in the medium to long term"" of 1 percent for the time being. It is likely that Japan's economy will return to a sustainable growth path with price stability in the longer run. 4. The Bank has been pursuing powerful monetary easing, with its virtually zero interest rate policy and implementation of the Program mainly through the purchase of financial assets. Such measures by the Bank have been supporting economic activity by encouraging a decline in longer-term interest rates and risk premiums, as well as by maintaining financial market stability. By continuing to pursue monetary easing with the virtually zero interest rate policy, easing effects are expected to strengthen on the back of progress in economic recovery. The Bank expects that, together with the cumulative effects of earlier policy measures, today's decision to further enhance monetary easing will better ensure the return of Japan's economy to a sustainable growth path with price stability. 5. In pursuing the above powerful monetary easing, the Bank will verify that there is no significant risk to the sustainability of economic growth, such as from the accumulation of financial imbalances. Given that the Bank pursues powerful monetary easing in a severe fiscal situation, it is extremely important to maintain credibility in fiscal sustainability in financial markets, for the sake of effective transmission of the effects of monetary policy, financial system stability, and sustainable economic growth. 6. In order to overcome deflation, it is crucial to tackle the long-term structural challenge of declining trend growth rates amid rapid population aging. In order to overcome this 2 challenge and establish a new basis for economic growth, business firms need to become more innovative in an effort to add value to their activities and explore new sources of demand both at home and abroad. With the aim of supporting such positive movements by firms, the government should seek to create a more conducive environment and private financial institutions should make efforts to strengthen the foundation for economic growth. As described above, the goal of overcoming deflation will be achieved through such continued efforts by business firms, financial institutions, the government, and the Bank within their respective roles. 3 Attachment Increase in the Asset Purchase Program (trillion yen) Program size Program size Program size after at the time of before Change in the increase establishment the increase amount [Intended time to [End-December [End-December [End-December [End-June complete the increase] 2011] 2012] 2012] 2013] (A) (B) (B) - (A) Total size About 35 About 65 About 65 About 70 About +5 Asset purchases 5.0 30.0 35.0 40.0 +10.0 Japanese government 1.5 19.0 24.0 29.0 +10.0 bonds[Note 1] Treasury discount bills 2.0 4.5 4.5 4.5 ― CP 0.5 2.1 2.1 2.1 ― Corporate bonds 0.5 2.9 2.9 2.9 ― Exchange-traded 0.45 1.4 1.6 1.6 +0.2 funds (ETFs)[Note 2] Japan real estate investment trusts 0.05 0.11 0.12 0.12 +0.01 (J-REITs)[Note 2] Fixed-rate funds-supplying 30.0 35.0 30.0 30.0 -5.0 operation against pooled collateral Three-month term 20.0 20.0 20.0 20.0 ― Six-month term 10.0 15.0 10.0 10.0 -5.0 Notes: 1.

At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period: The Bank of Japan will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at around 0 to 0.1 percent. 2. Overseas economies have shown some, albeit moderate, improvement, but on the whole still have not emerged from a deceleration phase. In global financial markets, some nervousness continues to be seen, mainly due to concern about the European debt problem. Particular attention should therefore be given to developments in these markets for the time being. 3. Japan's economic activity has started picking up moderately as domestic demand remains firm mainly supported by reconstruction-related demand. Public investment has continued to increase. Business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend with improvement in corporate profits. Against the background of improvement in consumer sentiment, private consumption has continued to increase moderately due to the effects of measures to stimulate demand for automobiles. Housing investment has generally been picking up. Exports have shown signs of a pick-up. Reflecting these developments in demand at home and abroad, production has started picking up moderately with some fluctuations. Under these circumstances, business sentiment has been improving moderately particularly in domestic demand-oriented sectors. Meanwhile, financial conditions in Japan have continued to ease. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is around 0 percent. 4. As for the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to return to a moderate recovery path as domestic demand remains firm and overseas economies emerge from the deceleration phase. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to remain at around 0 percent for the time being. 1 5. Compared with the forecasts presented in the April 2012 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, growth prospects will likely remain broadly unchanged. With regard to prices, the year-on-year rate of change in the domestic corporate goods price index will likely be somewhat lower for fiscal 2012 but broadly in line with the April forecasts for fiscal 2013. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is expected to be broadly in line with the April forecasts. 6. Regarding risks to the economic outlook, there remains a high degree of uncertainty about the global economy, including the prospects for the European debt problem, the momentum toward recovery for the U.S. economy, and the likelihood of emerging and commodity-exporting economies simultaneously achieving price stability and economic growth.

Recently, undersubscription (i.e., aggregate bids falling short of the Bank's offers) has taken place in the Bank's fixed-rate funds-supplying operation against pooled collateral and some other purchases. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board decided to adopt the following measures with the view to proceeding with the aforementioned monetary easing in a continuous manner by steadily increasing the amount outstanding of the Asset Purchase Program.1 (1) A reduction in the maximum outstanding amount of the Bank's fixed-rate funds-supplying operation against pooled collateral by about 5 trillion yen and an increase in the outright purchases of treasury discount bills by about 5 trillion yen 1 See Attachment for an overview of the Asset Purchase Program. 2 (2) A removal of the minimum bidding yield (currently 0.1 percent per annum) for the outright purchases of treasury discount bills and CP in order to ensure their smooth purchases (3) An integration of loan durations (currently ""3 months"" or ""6 months"") into ""within 6 months"" under the fixed-rate funds-supplying operation against pooled collateral in order to respond flexibly to liquidity demand by financial institutions 3 Appendix 1 Forecasts of the Majority of Policy Board Members y/y % chg.

At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan made the following decisions, by a unanimous vote, regarding the Asset Purchase Program (hereafter referred to as ""the Program"") with a view to further enhancing monetary easing. (1) The Bank decided to increase the total size of the Program by about 10 trillion yen, from about 70 trillion yen to about 80 trillion yen. The increase in the size of the Program corresponds with the size of additional purchases of treasury discount bills (T-Bills) by about 5 trillion yen and Japanese government bonds (JGBs) by about 5 trillion yen. The increased purchases under the Program will be completed by around end-2013. Specifically, additional purchases of T-Bills and JGBs will be completed by around end-June 2013 and around end-2013, respectively. Through these measures, the amount outstanding of the Program will be about 65 trillion yen by around end-2012, about 75 trillion yen by around end-June 2013, and about 80 trillion yen by around end-2013.1 (2) The Bank decided to remove the minimum bidding yield (currently 0.1 percent per annum) for the outright purchases of JGBs and corporate bonds in order to ensure their smooth purchase. 2. The Policy Board also decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period: The Bank of Japan will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at around 0 to 0.1 percent. 3. Overseas economies have moved somewhat deeper into a deceleration phase. In global financial markets, while investors' risk aversion on the back of the European debt problem has abated somewhat, particular attention should be given to developments in these markets. 4. Japan's economy registered relatively high growth in the first half of 2012, supported by the firmness in domestic demand. Nonetheless, the pick-up in economic activity has come to a 1 See Attachment for an overview of the Program. 1 pause, reflecting the aforementioned developments in overseas economies. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is around 0 percent, while the earlier fall in crude oil prices has been exerting downward pressure. Against the backdrop of these developments, economic activity is expected to level off more or less and the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI to remain at around 0 percent for the time being. Regarding risks, there remains a high degree of uncertainty about the global economy, including the prospects for the European debt problem, the momentum toward recovery for the U.S. economy, and the likelihood of emerging and commodity-exporting economies simultaneously achieving price stability and economic growth. Furthermore, attention should be paid to the effects of financial and foreign exchange market developments on economic activity and prices. 5. Based on these economic and price developments, the Bank of Japan judged it appropriate to expand the total size of the Program substantially by about 10 trillion yen and take the aforementioned measure to ensure the steady implementation of asset purchases. These measures in pursuit of powerful monetary easing will make financial conditions for such economic entities as firms and households even more accommodative by further encouraging a decline in longer-term market interest rates and a reduction in risk premiums. The Bank expects that, together with the cumulative effects of earlier policy measures, today's decision to enhance monetary easing will ensure the return of Japan's economy to a sustainable growth path with price stability. 6. The Bank recognizes that Japan's economy faces the critical challenge of overcoming deflation and returning to a sustainable growth path with price stability. This challenge will be met through efforts by a wide range of economic agents to strengthen the economy's growth potential and support from the financial side.

The Government and the Bank share the recognition that the critical challenge for Japan's economy is to overcome deflation as early as possible and to return to a sustainable growth path with price stability. The Government and the Bank will work together and make their utmost efforts to address this challenge. 2. The Bank recognizes that the challenge mentioned above will be met through the combination of (i) efforts by a wide range of economic agents to strengthen the economy's growth potential and (ii) support from the financial side. The Bank strongly expects the Government to vigorously promote measures for strengthening Japan's growth potential. The Bank judges ""the price stability goal in the medium to long term"" to be within a positive range of 2 percent or lower in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI. The Bank aims to achieve its goal of 1 percent for the time being in terms of the year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI through the pursuit of powerful monetary easing, conducting its virtually zero interest rate policy and implementing the Asset Purchase Program mainly through the purchase of financial assets. The Bank will continue with this powerful easing until it judges the 1 percent goal to be in sight. In doing so, it will ascertain whether there is any significant risk to the sustainability of economic growth, including from the accumulation of financial imbalances. In the October 2012 issue of the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices released on October 30, 2012, the Bank presented the projections for the CPI. The Bank will continue with this powerful easing aiming at achieving the goal of 1 percent. The Bank will report the outlook for prices regularly at the Ministerial Council on Exiting Deflation. The Bank will also continue to make efforts to explain its thinking on the conduct of monetary policy clearly to the market. 3. The Government strongly expects the Bank to continue powerful easing as outlined in section 2 until deflation is overcome. In order to overcome deflation, the Government recognizes that reforming the economic 1 structure predisposed to deflation is essential in addition to appropriate macroeconomic policy management. Therefore, based on the Prime Minister's instruction on October 17, 2012, the Government will promptly formulate economic policy measures to counter risks of a downturn that Japan's economy faces at this juncture and to accelerate measures for realizing economic revitalization. In addition, based on the ""Comprehensive Strategy for the Rebirth of Japan,"" which was decided by the Cabinet on July 31, 2012, the Government, focusing on through fiscal 2013, will mobilize optimal policy measures including regulatory and institutional reforms, budget, fiscal investment and loan program, and tax in order to dynamically mobilize ""goods,"" ""people,"" and ""money."" The Government will assess the economic developments including the state of deflation and the macroeconomic management regularly at the Ministerial Council on Exiting Deflation.

At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan made the following decisions with a view to further pursuing aggressive monetary easing. (1) Increase in the total size of the Asset Purchase Program (hereafter referred to as ""the Program""): unanimous vote The Bank decided to increase the total size of the Program by about 11 trillion yen, from about 80 trillion yen to about 91 trillion yen in order to make financial conditions for such economic entities as firms and households even more accommodative by further encouraging a decline in longer-term market interest rates and a reduction in risk premiums. The increase in the size of respective assets under the Program is as follows, and the Bank intends to complete the increased purchases by around end-2013 (see Attachment 1 for an overview of the Program).1 Japanese government bonds (JGBs): about 5 trillion yen Treasury discount bills (T-Bills): about 5 trillion yen CP: about 0.1 trillion yen Corporate bonds: about 0.3 trillion yen Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): about 0.5 trillion yen Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs): about 0.01 trillion yen (2) Establishment of the Framework for the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Stimulate Bank Lending (""Stimulating Bank Lending Facility""): unanimous vote The Bank decided to provide long-term funds -- up to the amount equivalent to the net increase in lending -- at a low interest rate to financial institutions at their request, with the view to promoting their aggressive action and helping increase proactive credit demand of firms and households. There shall be no upper limit -- unlimited -- to the total amount of funds provided by the Bank under this facility. The Chairman instructed 1 The increases in the purchases of ETFs and J-REITs are conditional on obtaining authorization in accordance with the Bank of Japan Act. 1 the staff to examine the specifics of establishing the framework for this new facility and report back at a Monetary Policy Meeting (see Attachment 2 for the outline of the preliminary framework). 2. The Policy Board also decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period: The Bank of Japan will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at around 0 to 0.1 percent. 3. Overseas economies have moved deeper into a deceleration phase. In global financial markets, while investors' risk aversion on the back of the European debt problem has abated somewhat, particular attention should be given to developments in these markets. Under such circumstances, exports and industrial production have decreased, starting to affect domestic demand which has remained firm thus far. As such, Japan's economy has been weakening somewhat. Meanwhile, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is around 0 percent. Going forward, there remains a high degree of uncertainty concerning Japan's economy, including the prospects for the European debt problem, the momentum toward recovery for the U.S. economy, the possibility of emerging and commodity-exporting economies making a smooth transition to the sustainable growth path, and the spreading effects of the recent bilateral relationship between Japan and China. Furthermore, attention should continue to be paid to the effects of financial and foreign exchange market developments on economic activity and prices. 4. Based on these economic and price developments, the Bank of Japan judged it appropriate to undertake further aggressive monetary easing policies in order to prevent Japan's economy from deviating from the path of returning to a sustainable growth path with price stability. 5. The Bank recognizes that Japan's economy faces the critical challenge of overcoming deflation as early as possible and returning to the sustainable growth path with price stability. This challenge will be met through the combination of (i) efforts by a wide range of economic agents -- such as business firms and financial institutions -- to strengthen the economy's growth potential and (ii) support from the financial side. 6. In order to address this challenge, it is necessary for the Government and the Bank of Japan to play their respective roles. The Bank, based on the aforementioned recognition, will 2 pursue powerful monetary easing. It strongly expects the Government to vigorously promote measures for strengthening Japan's growth potential, based on the Government's recognition that in order to overcome deflation reforming the economic structure predisposed to deflation is essential in addition to appropriate macroeconomic policy management. In order to state clearly the shared understanding concerning the roles of the Government and the Bank, the Bank decided to release today ""Measures Aimed at Overcoming Deflation"" along with the Government (see Attachment 3). The Bank believes that this release will contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of respective policy measures. 3 Attachment 1 Size of the Asset Purchase Program (trillion yen) Amount outstanding Program size Change in (as of (Figures in parentheses represent amount end-September the size before today's decision.) 2012) End-December End-June End-December End-December 2012 2013 2013 2013 About 78 About 91 Total size [Note s 1,2] About 61.8 About 65 About +11 (About 75) (About 80) 53 66 Asset purchases 31. 1 40 +11 (50) (55) [Note 3] 31. 5 39. 0 JGBs 18. 1 24. 0 +5. 0 (29. 0) (34. 0) 14. 5 19. 5 T-Bills 7. 4 9. 5 +5. 0 (14. 5) (14. 5) 2. 2 CP 1. 4 2. 1 --> +0. 1 (2. 1) 3. 2 Corporate bonds 2. 7 2. 9 --> +0. 3 (2. 9) Exchange-traded funds 2. 1 [Note 4] 1. 4 1. 6 --> +0. 5 (ETFs) (1. 6) Japan real estate investment trusts 0. 13 0. 10 0. 12 --> +0. 01 (0. 12) (J-REITs) [Note 4] Fixed-rate funds-supplying 25. 0 25. 0 operation against pooled 30. 7 25. 0 ― (25. 0) (25. 0) collateral Notes: 1.

The increase in the size of the program corresponds with the size of additional purchases of treasury discount bills (T-Bills) by about 5 trillion yen and Japanese government bonds (JGBs) by about 5 trillion yen (see Attachment 2). Additional purchases of financial assets to be made in the next twelve months under the Asset Purchase Program -- inclusive of those purchases that have already been decided -- will amount to about 36 trillion yen.

They will strengthen their policy coordination in order to overcome deflation and achieve sustainable economic growth. Attachment Joint Statement of the Government and the Bank of Japan on Overcoming Deflation and Achieving Sustainable Economic Growth 1. In order to overcome deflation early and achieve sustainable economic growth with price stability, the Government and the Bank of Japan will strengthen their policy coordination and work together as follows. 2. The Bank of Japan conducts monetary policy based on the principle that the policy shall be aimed at achieving price stability, thereby contributing to the sound development of the national economy, and is responsible for maintaining financial system stability. The Bank aims to achieve price stability on a sustainable basis, given that there are various factors that affect prices in the short run. The Bank recognizes that the inflation rate consistent with price stability on a sustainable basis will rise as efforts by a wide range of entities toward strengthening competitiveness and growth potential of Japan's economy make progress. Based on this recognition, the Bank sets the price stability target at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index. Under the price stability target specified above, the Bank will pursue monetary easing and aim to achieve this target at the earliest possible time. Taking into consideration that it will take considerable time before the effects of monetary policy permeate the economy, the Bank will ascertain whether there is any significant risk to the sustainability of economic growth, including from the accumulation of financial imbalances. 3. The Government will, in order to revitalize Japan's economy, not only flexibly manage macroeconomic policy but also formulate measures for strengthening competitiveness and growth potential of Japan's economy, and promote them strongly under the leadership of the Headquarters for Japan's Economic Revitalization. Those measures include all possible decisive policy actions for reforming the economic structure, such as concentrating resources on innovative research and development, strengthening the 1 foundation for innovation, carrying out bold regulatory and institutional reforms and better utilizing the tax system. In addition, in strengthening coordination between the Government and the Bank of Japan, the Government will steadily promote measures aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure with a view to ensuring the credibility of fiscal management. 4. The Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy will regularly review the progress in the conduct of macroeconomic policies including monetary policy, the current condition and future prospects of prices in the context of the price stability target under those policies, economic and fiscal situation including employment conditions, and progress in economic structural reform. 2",2013-01-22,"2013-01"
"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/mpr_2013/k130122b.pdf"," Bank of Japan The ""Price Stability Target"" under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy 1. The Bank of Japan conducts monetary policy based on the principle that the policy shall be aimed at ""achieving price stability, thereby contributing to the sound development of the national economy."" At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board reviewed the ""price stability goal in the medium to long term"" adopted in February 2012, in light of the above-mentioned principle. As a result, it decided to introduce the ""price stability target"" and restate the framework for the conduct of monetary policy. 2. ""Price stability"" is defined conceptually as ""a state where various economic agents including households and firms may make decisions regarding such economic activities as consumption and investments without being concerned about the fluctuations in the general price level."" Therefore, ""price stability"" must be the one on a sustainable basis. 3. The newly-introduced ""price stability target"" is the inflation rate that the Bank judges to be consistent with price stability on a sustainable basis. The Bank recognizes that the inflation rate consistent with price stability on a sustainable basis will rise as efforts by a wide range of entities toward strengthening competitiveness and growth potential of Japan's economy make progress. Based on this recognition, the Bank sets the ""price stability target"" at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) -- a main price index. 4. Previously, the ""price stability goal in the medium to long term"" was in a positive range of 2 percent or lower in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI and the Bank set a goal at 1 percent for the time being. This time, replacing a ""goal"" with a ""target"" and setting that target at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change 1 in the CPI are based on the following recognition. The Bank recognizes that the inflation rate consistent with price stability on a sustainable basis will rise as efforts by a wide range of entities toward strengthening competitiveness and growth potential of Japan's economy make progress. Today's expected rate of inflation has been shaped over the years. As the strengthening of growth potential makes progress going forward, the actual rate of inflation would gradually rise and accordingly the expected inflation rate of households and firms is likely to rise as well. Going forward, as prices are expected to rise moderately, it is judged appropriate to clearly indicate the target of 2 percent in order to anchor the sustainable rate of inflation. Switching from a ""goal"" to a ""target"" reflects an increasing awareness regarding the importance of flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy in Japan. The effects of monetary policy permeating economic activity and thereafter prices require a considerable and variable time lag. The conduct of monetary policy has to be flexible by examining various risk factors, including those related to financial imbalances, in addition to the assessment of current developments and outlook for economic activity and prices, from the perspective of achieving sustainable growth with price stability. Such understanding has been widely shared around the globe; particularly, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, major economies of the world have come to emphasize flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy -- by, for example, publicly articulating the importance of paying due attention to financial system stability. Over the last year, there has been an increasing awareness of such understanding in Japan as well. In such circumstances, it is judged transparent and appropriate to use the expression, ""target,"" in order to explain the Bank's thinking on price stability. 5. In order for Japan's economy to overcome deflation as early as possible and return to a sustainable growth path with price stability, efforts by a wide range of entities to strengthen growth potential are crucial. The Bank will continue to thoroughly examine the progress toward strengthening growth potential and the ensuing developments in the expected inflation rate of households and firms. In the meantime, the Government has shown its intention to aggressively pursue steps for strengthening competitiveness and growth potential of Japan's economy and to steadily promote 2 measures aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure. 6. The Bank will continue to conduct monetary policy, based on its assessment of economic activity and prices from two perspectives, in the context of the ""price stability target."" The first perspective is examining, as regards economic activity and prices over the next two years or so, whether the outlook deemed most likely by the Bank of Japan follows a path of sustainable growth under price stability. The second perspective is examining, in a longer term, various risks that are most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy aimed at achieving sustainable growth under price stability. In particular, financial imbalances will be examined as a risk that will significantly impact economic activity and prices when they materialize, although the probability of their emergence is low. The Bank of Japan will, in light of deliberations from the two perspectives described above, outline the current view on monetary policy, and disclose it periodically mainly in the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report). 3",2013-01-22,"2013-01"

At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan took additional steps to provide monetary accommodation decisively. Specifically, the Bank decided to (1) introduce the ""price stability target,"" and (2) introduce the ""open-ended asset purchasing method"" (i.e., to purchase assets without setting any termination date) under the Asset Purchase Program. Furthermore, the Bank decided to release the joint statement with the Government. (1) Introduction of the ""price stability target""1 The Bank held the discussion concerning its thinking on price stability and decided to introduce the ""price stability target."" In addition, the Bank decided to release ""The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy"" (see Attachment 1). The Bank recognizes that the inflation rate consistent with price stability on a sustainable basis will rise as efforts by a wide range of entities toward strengthening competitiveness and growth potential of Japan's economy make progress. Based on this recognition, the Bank sets the price stability target at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI). Under the price stability target specified above, the Bank will pursue monetary easing and aim to achieve this target at the earliest possible time. Taking into consideration that it will take considerable time before the effects of monetary policy permeate the economy, the Bank will ascertain whether there is any significant risk to the sustainability of economic growth, including from the accumulation of financial imbalances. 1 (2) Introduction of the ""open-ended asset purchasing method""2 The Bank will pursue aggressive monetary easing, aiming to achieve the above-mentioned price stability target, through a virtually zero interest rate policy and purchases of financial assets, as long as the Bank judges it appropriate to continue with each policy measure respectively.3, 4 With respect to the Asset Purchase Program, after completing the current purchasing method, from January 2014, the Bank will introduce a method of purchasing a certain amount of financial assets every month without setting any termination date. Particularly, for some time, following the introduction of this method, the amount of monthly purchases is specified at about 13 trillion yen, 2 trillion yen of which is JGBs (see Attachment 2 for the purchases of financial assets). As a result of these measures, the total size of the Asset Purchase Program will be increased by about 10 trillion yen in 2014 and is expected to be maintained thereafter. In the pursuit of monetary easing, taking into consideration that it will take considerable time before the effects of monetary policy permeate the economy, the Bank will ascertain whether there is any significant risk to the sustainability of economic growth, including from the accumulation of financial imbalances. (3) Joint statement of the Government and the Bank of Japan5 The Bank decided to release the statement titled ""Joint Statement of the Government and the Bank of Japan on Overcoming Deflation and Achieving Sustainable Economic Growth"" with the Government (see Attachment 3). 2. The Policy Board also decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period: The Bank of Japan will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at around 0 to 0.1 percent. 3. Overseas economies remain in a deceleration phase. In global financial markets, investors' risk aversion has abated, although developments require continued attention. 2 4. Japan's economy remains relatively weak. Exports and industrial production have decreased, reflecting the aforementioned developments in overseas economies. Business fixed investment has shown some weakness on the whole, although resilience has been observed in nonmanufacturing. In contrast, public investment has continued to increase, and housing investment has generally been picking up. Private consumption has remained resilient and the effects of the decline in car sales due to the ending of some measures to stimulate demand for automobiles have diminished. Meanwhile, financial conditions in Japan are accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is around 0 percent. 5. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to level off more or less for the time being, and thereafter, it will return to a moderate recovery path as domestic demand remains resilient partly due to the effects of various economic measures and overseas economies gradually emerge from the deceleration phase. For the time being, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to turn negative due to the reversal of the previous year's movements in energy-related and durable consumer goods, and thereafter, it is likely to be around 0 percent again. 6. Compared with the forecasts presented in the October 2012 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, growth prospects will likely be somewhat lower for fiscal 2012, but they will likely be higher for fiscal 2013 partly due to the effects of various economic measures. Growth prospects for fiscal 2014 will likely be broadly in line with the October forecasts. With regard to prices, the year-on-year rate of change in the domestic corporate goods price index will likely be somewhat higher especially for fiscal 2013 mainly due to movements in foreign exchange rates. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) will likely be broadly in line with the October forecasts. 7. Regarding risks, there remains a high degree of uncertainty concerning Japan's economy, including the prospects for the European debt problem, the momentum toward recovery for the U.S. economy, the possibility of emerging and commodity-exporting economies making a smooth transition to the sustainable growth path, and the effects of the recent bilateral relationship between Japan and China. 3 8. The Bank recognizes that Japan's economy faces the critical challenge of overcoming deflation as early as possible and returning to the sustainable growth path with price stability. This challenge will be met through the combination of efforts by a wide range of entities to strengthen the economy's growth potential and support from the financial side. Based on this recognition, the Bank will, as mentioned above, pursue aggressive monetary easing. The Bank expects that the Government will surely implement measures, specified in the ""Joint Statement,"" such as carrying out bold regulatory and institutional reforms, and furthermore, steadily promote measures aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure. 1 7-2 majority vote (",2013-01-22,"2013-01"

At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) The introduction of the ""quantitative and qualitative monetary easing"" The Bank will achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) at the earliest possible time, with a time horizon of about two years.[Note 1] In order to do so, it will enter a new phase of monetary easing both in terms of quantity and quality. It will double the monetary base and the amounts outstanding of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) as well as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in two years, and more than double the average remaining maturity of JGB purchases. a) The adoption of the ""monetary base control"" by a unanimous vote With a view to pursuing quantitative monetary easing, the main operating target for money market operations is changed from the uncollateralized overnight call rate to the monetary base. Specifically, the guideline for money market operations is set as follows: The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 60-70 trillion yen. 1 b) An increase in JGB purchases and their maturity extension by a unanimous vote With a view to encouraging a further decline in interest rates across the yield curve, the Bank will purchase JGBs so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen. 2 In addition, JGBs with all maturities including 40-year bonds will be made eligible for purchase, and the average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be extended from slightly less than three years at present to about seven years -- equivalent 1 Under this guideline, the monetary base -- whose amount outstanding was 138 trillion yen at end-2012 -- is expected to reach 200 trillion yen at end-2013 and 270 trillion yen at end-2014 (see Attachment). 2 The monthly flow of JGB purchases is expected to become 7+ trillion yen on a gross basis. 1 to the average maturity of the amount outstanding of JGBs issued. 3, 4 c) An increase in ETF and J-REIT purchases by a unanimous vote With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices, the Bank will purchase ETFs and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at an annual pace of 1 trillion yen and 30 billion yen respectively. 5 d) The continuation of the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing by an 8-1 majority vote [Note 1] [Note 2] The Bank will continue with the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate. (2) Actions accompanied by the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing a) The termination of the Asset Purchase Program The Asset Purchase Program will be terminated. The purchases of JGBs conducted for facilitating money market operations -- including the amount outstanding of JGBs already purchased -- will be absorbed into the aforementioned JGB purchases. b) The temporary suspension of the ""banknote principle"" The aforementioned JGB purchases are executed for the purpose of conducting monetary policy and not for the purpose of financing fiscal deficits. In addition, the government -- in the joint statement released with the Bank in January -- stated that ""in strengthening coordination between the Government and the Bank of Japan, the Government will steadily promote measures aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure with a view to ensuring the credibility of fiscal management."" Based on such recognition, the Bank will temporarily suspend the so-called banknote principle as it pursues the quantitative 3 The average remaining maturity of JGBs purchased under the Asset Purchase Program and JGB purchases conducted for facilitating money market operations was slightly less than three years. 4 The average remaining maturity of JGBs to be purchased is subject to fluctuations, depending on bids by financial institutions; thus, it is appropriate to allow for its range of about six to eight years. 5 As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will continue with those asset purchases until their amounts outstanding reach 2.2 trillion yen and 3.2 trillion yen respectively; thereafter, it will maintain those amounts outstanding. The upper limits (i.e., the single issuers' amounts outstanding) of CP, corporate bonds, ETFs, and J-REITs to be purchased by the Bank shall be the same as before. 2 and qualitative monetary easing. 6 c) Enhanced dialogue with market participants In order to facilitate the aforementioned massive JGB purchases and significantly large-scale provision of the monetary base, the cooperation of market participants -- such as counterparties' active bidding in the Bank's market operations -- is vital. The Bank will set forums for enhanced dialogue with those market participants in order to exchange views pertaining to money market operations and market transactions more generally. In addition, the terms and conditions under the Securities Lending Facility (SLF) will be relaxed for the time being in order to ensure that the market liquidity of JGBs is maintained. (3) The extension of the funds-supplying operation to support financial institutions in disaster areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake The periods -- for which (i) the funds-supplying operation to support financial institutions in disaster areas and (ii) the amendment to temporary rules regarding the eligibility standards for debt of companies in disaster areas will remain effective -- will be extended by one year. 2. Japan's economy has stopped weakening and has shown some signs of picking up. With regard to the outlook, it is expected to return to a moderate recovery path against the background of firm domestic demand and a pick-up in growth rates of overseas economies. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has recently been slightly negative, but some indicators suggest a rise in inflation expectations. In recent months, conditions in financial markets have turned favorable due to the abatement of global investors' risk aversion and expectations for domestic policies. The Bank of Japan -- in the joint statement released with the government in January -- has made a clear commitment to achieving the price stability target at the earliest possible time. The quantitative and qualitative monetary easing, introduced by the Bank today, will underpin the Bank's commitment, and is expected not only to work through such transmission channels like longer-term interest rates and asset prices but also to drastically change the 6 This principle indicates that the purchases of JGBs conducted for facilitating money market operations are subject to the limitation that the outstanding amount of long-term government bonds effectively held by the Bank be kept below the outstanding balance of banknotes issued.

These effects will support the positive movements that have started to appear in economic activity and financial markets, contribute to a further pick-up in inflation expectations that appear to have risen, and lead Japan's economy to overcome deflation that has lasted for nearly 15 years. [Note 1] Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed (i) to delete ""with a time horizon of about two years,"" (ii) to add the following sentence, ""The Bank introduces the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing while setting the time frame of about two years as intensive periods for aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent,"" and (iii) to delete ""The continuation of the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing.""

At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period: The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 60-70 trillion yen. 2. With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank will continue with the following guidelines: a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen, and the average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about seven years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 1 trillion yen and about 30 billion yen respectively. c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen respectively. 3. The Policy Board also decided, by a unanimous vote, to double the scale of (i) the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Stimulate Bank Lending (hereafter ""Stimulating Bank Lending Facility"") and (ii) the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth (hereafter ""Growth-Supporting Funding Facility""), and to extend the application period for these facilities by one year.1 Before today's decision, these were due to expire shortly. Specifically, under the Stimulating Bank Lending Facility, financial institutions will be able to borrow funds from the Bank up to an amount that is twice as much as the net increase in their lending. As for the Growth-Supporting Funding Facility, the maximum amount of the Bank's fund-provisioning under the main rules will be doubled from 3.5 trillion yen to 7 1 See Attachment for details. 1 trillion yen. Under these facilities, financial institutions will be able to borrow funds at a fixed rate of 0.1 percent per annum for 4 years instead of 1-3 years at present. The Bank expects that these enhancements will further promote financial institutions' actions as well as stimulate firms' and households' demand for credit, with a view to encouraging banks' lending and strengthening the foundations for economic growth. 4. Furthermore, the Policy Board decided, by a unanimous vote, to extend the Funds-Supplying Operation to Support Financial Institutions in Disaster Areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Temporary Rules regarding the Eligibility Standards for Debt of Companies in Disaster Areas by one year. 5. Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately, and a front-loaded increase in demand prior to the consumption tax hike has recently been observed.

The average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be extended to about 7-10 years (an extension of about 3 years at maximum compared with the past). b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 3 trillion yen (tripled compared with the past) and about 90 billion yen (tripled compared with the past), respectively. The Bank will make ETFs that track the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 eligible for purchase.1 2. Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately as a trend and is expected to continue growing at a pace above its potential. However, on the price front, somewhat weak developments in demand following the consumption tax hike and a substantial decline in crude oil prices have been exerting downward pressure recently. A temporary weakness in 1 As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively (as in the past). 1 demand has already started to wane, and the decline in crude oil prices will have positive effects on economic activity from a somewhat longer-term perspective and will push up prices. Nevertheless, if the current downward pressure on prices remains, albeit in the short term, there is a risk that conversion of deflationary mindset, which has so far been progressing steadily, might be delayed. To pre-empt manifestation of such risk and to maintain the improving momentum of expectation formation, the Bank judged it appropriate to expand the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE). 3. The Bank will continue with the QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate.2 [Note 3] [Note 1] ",2014-10-31,"2014-10"

At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period: The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 60-70 trillion yen. 2. With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank will continue with the following guidelines: a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen, and the average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about seven years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 1 trillion yen and about 30 billion yen respectively. c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen respectively. 3. Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately as a trend, although some weakness particularly on the production side has been observed due mainly to the effects of the subsequent decline in demand following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike. Overseas economies -- mainly advanced economies -- have been recovering, albeit with a lackluster performance still seen in part. Exports have shown some weakness. Business fixed investment has increased moderately as corporate profits have improved. Public investment has more or less leveled off at a high level. Private consumption has remained resilient as a trend with the employment and income situation improving steadily, and the effects of the decline in demand following the front-loaded increase have been waning on the whole, albeit unevenly. As for housing investment, the decline following the front-loaded increase has continued. Industrial production has recently been showing some weakness, due in part to inventory adjustments. Business sentiment has generally stayed at 1 a favorable level, although its improvement has paused due mainly to the effects of the consumption tax hike. Meanwhile, financial conditions are accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food), excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike, is around 1¼ percent. Inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole.[Note 1] 4. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to continue its moderate recovery trend, and the effects including those of the subsequent decline in demand following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike are expected to wane gradually. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be around 1¼ percent for some time. 5. Risks to the outlook include developments in the emerging and commodity-exporting economies, the prospects for the European debt problem, and the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy. 6. Quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) has been exerting its intended effects, and the Bank will continue with the QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate.[Note 2] [Note 1] Ms. S. Shirai dissented from the description on inflation expectations, and suggested changing it to a new expression that inflation expectations have been on an uptrend from a somewhat longer-term perspective, although an increasing number of indicators have recently been more or less flat. [Note 2] Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that the Bank will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in the medium to long term and designate the QQE as an intensive measure with a time frame of about two years.

In this situation, exports have been picking up. Business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have improved. Against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation, private consumption has been resilient and housing investment has started to pick up. Meanwhile, public investment has entered a moderate declining trend, although it remains at a high level.

More specifically, this contribution is expected to fall further into negative territory for the time being, followed by a narrowing in the negative contribution in the second half of fiscal 2015; in the first half of fiscal 2016, the contribution is estimated to be around 0 percentage point. 2 [Note 1] ",2015-07-15,"2015-07"

At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided to introduce ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with a Negative Interest Rate"" in order to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time. Going forward, the Bank will pursue monetary easing by making full use of possible measures in terms of three dimensions; quantity, quality, and interest rate. (1) Interest-Rate Dimension: The introduction of a negative interest rate by a 5-4 majority vote[Note 1] The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to current accounts that financial institutions hold at the Bank.1 It will cut the interest rate further into negative territory if judged as necessary. Specifically, the Bank will adopt a three-tier system in which the outstanding balance of each financial institution's current account at the Bank will be divided into three tiers, to each of which a positive interest rate, a zero interest rate, or a negative interest rate will be applied, respectively (see Attachment for details).2 The Bank will carry out the Loan Support Program, the Funds-Supplying Operation to Support Financial Institutions in Disaster Areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake, and the Funds-Supplying Operations against Pooled Collateral at zero interest rates. 1 A negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent will be effective from the reserve maintenance period, which commences from February16, 2016. 2 A multiple-tier system is intended to prevent an excessive decrease in financial institutions' earnings stemming from the implementation of negative interest rates that could weaken their functions as financial intermediaries. Multiple-tier systems are adopted in countries where the size of negative interest rates is relatively large, including Switzerland (minus 0.75 percent), Sweden (minus 1.1 percent), and Denmark (minus 0.65 percent). 1 (2) Quantity Dimension: The guideline for money market operations The Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period:[Note 2] The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. (3) Quality Dimension: The guidelines for asset purchases With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guidelines:[Note 2] a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. 3 With a view to encouraging a decline in interest rates across the entire yield curve, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner in accordance with financial market conditions. The average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about 7-12 years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 3 trillion yen4 and about 90 billion yen, respectively. c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively. (4) The continuation of ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" The Bank will continue with ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will examine risks to economic activity and prices, and take additional easing measures in terms of three dimensions -- quantity, quality, and interest rate -- if it is judged necessary for achieving the price stability target. [Note 3] 3 As before, the Bank will not set a lower bound for yields on its JGB purchases. Thus, the Bank can carry out outright purchases of JGBs with negative yields lower than minus 0.1 percent. 4 In addition to the current program of ETF purchases, the Bank will commence purchasing ETFs under a new program from April 2016 at an annual pace of about 300 billion yen, which was decided at the Monetary Policy Meeting on December 17 and 18, 2015. Under this new program, the Bank will purchase ETFs composed of stocks issued by firms that are proactively investing in physical and human capital. 2 2. Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating in both the household and corporate sectors, and the underlying trend in inflation has been rising steadily. Recently, however, global financial markets have been volatile against the backdrop of the further decline in crude oil prices and uncertainty such as over future developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies, particularly the Chinese economy. For these reasons, there is an increasing risk that an improvement in the business confidence of Japanese firms and conversion of the deflationary mindset might be delayed and that the underlying trend in inflation might be negatively affected. 3. To preempt the manifestation of this risk and to maintain momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, the Bank decided to introduce ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate."" The Bank will lower the short end of the yield curve by slashing its deposit rate on current accounts into negative territory and will exert further downward pressure on interest rates across the entire yield curve, in combination with large-scale purchases of JGBs. In addition, this policy framework is designed to enable the Bank to pursue additional monetary easing in terms of three dimensions, combining a negative interest rate with quantity and quality. By making full use of ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate,"" the Bank will achieve the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time. [Note 1] ",2016-01-29,"2016-01"

The average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about 7-12 years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 3 trillion yen until the end of March 2016 and, from April, at an annual pace of about 3.3 trillion yen.1 It will also purchase Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 90 billion yen. c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively. 1 Of about 3.3 trillion yen, 300 billion yen will be used in line with the implementation of a new program for purchasing ETFs composed of stocks issued by firms that are proactively investing in physical and human capital, which was decided at the MPM held in December 2015. 1 (3) Interest-Rate Dimension: The policy rate The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to continue applying a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank.[Note 2] 2. Japan's economy has continued its moderate recovery trend, although exports and production have been sluggish due mainly to the effects of the slowdown in emerging economies. Overseas economies have continued to grow at a moderate pace, but the pace of growth has somewhat decelerated mainly in emerging economies. In this situation, the pick-up in exports has recently paused. On the domestic demand side, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have been at high levels. Against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation, private consumption has been resilient. Meanwhile, the pick-up in housing investment has recently paused and public investment has been on a moderate declining trend, albeit remaining at a high level. Reflecting these developments in demand both at home and abroad, industrial production has continued to be more or less flat. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is about 0 percent. Although inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole from a somewhat longer-term perspective, they have recently weakened. 3. With regard to the outlook, although sluggishness is expected to remain in exports and production for the time being, domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the household and corporate sectors, and exports are expected to increase moderately on the back of emerging economies moving out of their deceleration phase. Thus, Japan's economy is likely to be on a moderate expanding trend. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be about 0 percent for the time being, due to the effects of the decline in energy prices, and, as the underlying trend in inflation steadily rises, accelerate toward 2 percent.[Note 3] 4. Risks to the outlook include uncertainties surrounding emerging and commodity-exporting economies, particularly China, developments in the U.S. economy and the influences of its monetary policy response to them on the global financial markets, prospects regarding the European debt problem and the momentum of economic activity and prices in Europe, and geopolitical risks. Against this backdrop, global financial markets have remained volatile. Therefore, due attention still needs to be paid to a risk that an improvement in the business 2 confidence of Japanese firms and conversion of the deflationary mindset might be delayed and that the underlying trend in inflation might be negatively affected. 5. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with a Negative Interest Rate,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will examine risks to economic activity and prices, and take additional easing measures in terms of three dimensions -- quantity, quality, and the interest rate -- if it is judged necessary for achieving the price stability target.[Note 4] 6. With a view to implementing ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" smoothly, the Bank decided on operational details. Namely, (1) each financial institution's ""Macro Add-on Balance,"" to which a zero interest rate is applied, will be reviewed every three months in principle; (2) in light of the role of money reserve funds (MRFs) in fund settlement for securities transactions, the amount outstanding of MRFs entrusted to a trust bank will be added to its Macro Add-on Balance (up to the amount outstanding of MRFs entrusted to this trust bank during the previous year); and (3) with the aim of further supporting financial institutions' efforts to increase lending, in case where a financial institution increases the amount outstanding of borrowing from the Bank through the Loan Support Program and the Funds-Supplying Operation to Support Financial Institutions in Disaster Areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake, twice as much as the amount of increase will be added to this financial institution's Macro Add-on Balance.2 2 For details on (1) and (2), see ""Amendment to 'Principal Terms and Conditions of Complementary Deposit Facility'"" released today. An amendment to the Principal Terms and Conditions in relation to (3) will be made at the next MPM, and it will take effect from the May 2016 reserve maintenance period. As decided at the MPM held last January, with regard to the existing amount of borrowing from the Bank through these facilities, the corresponding amount of current account balance will be added to the Macro Add-on Balance. In case where a financial institution decreases the amount outstanding of such borrowing, an amount equivalent to the decrease will be deducted from that Balance. 3 [Note 1] ",2016-03-15,"2016-03"

Against the backdrop of the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union and the slowdown in emerging economies, uncertainties surrounding overseas economies have increased and volatile developments have continued in the global financial markets. In order to prevent these uncertainties from leading to a deterioration in business confidence and consumer sentiment as well as to ensure smooth funding in foreign currencies by Japanese firms and financial institutions, thereby supporting their proactive economic activities, at the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) An increase in purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by a 7-2 majority vote[Note 1] The Bank will purchase ETFs so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 6 trillion yen1 (almost double the previous pace of about 3.3 trillion yen).

I. Introduction More than three years have passed since the Bank introduced QQE in April 2013. In this period, Japan's economic activity and prices have improved significantly, and Japan's economy is no longer in deflation, which is generally defined as a sustained decline in prices. However, despite the Bank's large-scale monetary easing, the price stability target of 2 percent has not been achieved. Against this background, this report examines how the intended mechanism of QQE has actually worked and what factors have hampered the achievement of the 2 percent target. Half a year has passed since the Bank introduced ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate."" Since the introduction of this measure, Japanese government bond (JGB) yields, lending rates, and interest rates on corporate bonds and CP have declined considerably, meaning that the measure has had substantial effects. At the same time, it has also had a substantial impact on financial markets and financial institutions. The effects and impact of the negative interest rate are also going to be assessed. II. Developments in Economic Activity and Prices as well as Policy Effects over the Three Years since the Introduction of QQE A. Transmission Mechanism of QQE Envisioned When It Was Introduced QQE has lowered real interest rates by raising inflation expectations and pushing down nominal interest rates. Although the natural rate of interest has followed a downward trend, real interest rates have been well below the natural rate of interest, leading to an improvement in financial conditions. As a result, economic activity and price developments improved, and Japan's economy is no longer in deflation, which is commonly defined as a sustained decline in prices. When the Bank introduced QQE, the transmission mechanism of monetary easing it envisaged was as follows. The main transmission channel of QQE would be the reduction in real interest rates. Namely, (1) people's deflationary mindset would be dispelled and inflation expectations would be raised through the Bank's large-scale monetary easing under its strong and clear 1 commitment to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. At the same time, (2) downward pressure would be put on nominal interest rates across the entire yield curve through the Bank's purchases of JGBs. (3) Together, these developments would reduce real interest rates. (4) The decline in real interest rates would lead to an improvement in the output gap. (5) The improvement in the output gap, together with rising inflation expectations, would push up the observed inflation rate. (6) Once people experienced an actual rise in the inflation rate, they would adapt their inflation expectations, resulting in higher inflation expectations and further reinforcing this process (Chart 1 ""Transmission Mechanism of QQE Envisioned When It Was Introduced""). In addition, it was envisaged that as a result of the Bank's monetary easing, (7) asset prices such as stock prices as well as the foreign exchange rate would reflect actual or anticipated improvements in economic activity and prices, thereby improving financial conditions and having a positive impact on economic activity and prices. Finally, it was envisaged that (8) it would work through the portfolio rebalancing effect by increasing investors' appetite for risky assets, thereby exerting a positive effect on prices of risky assets and leading to an increase in lending. The following sections examine developments in economic activity and prices as well as the impact of QQE in detail in light of the transmission mechanism just described. Overall, QQE to a large extent has had the intended effects. Looking at financial and economic developments since the introduction of QQE, real interest rates have declined, reflecting increased inflation expectations and a decline in nominal interest rates across the entire yield curve. Against this backdrop, Japan's economy is no longer in deflation, which is generally defined as a sustained decline in prices. Specifically, in terms of the real economy, the output gap has improved to around 0 percent, which is the long-term average, and the unemployment rate has declined to around 3 percent. On the price front, the rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) for all items less fresh food and energy -- which shows the underlying trend in prices -- turned positive from a level of about minus 0.5 percent before the introduction of QQE and has remained in positive territory for more than two and a half years. 2 B. Developments in Inflation Expectations However, the price stability target of 2 percent has not been achieved. In terms of the mechanism described above, this is largely due to developments in inflation expectations. The following two factors have played a role in the development of inflation expectations. First, exogenous developments, including (1) the decline in crude oil prices, (2) the weakness in demand following the consumption tax hike in April 2014, and (3) the slowdown in emerging economies and volatile global financial markets, have lowered the observed inflation rate. And second, amid this decline in the observed inflation rate, inflation expectations -- after having been largely flat -- weakened, reflecting the fact that expectations formation in Japan is largely adaptive, that is, backward-looking. There are several ways to gauge inflation expectations, including market indicators estimated, for example, using the yields of inflation-indexed JGBs, as well as indicators based on the results of surveys of households, firms, or experts (such as economists or market participants). While short-term fluctuations vary across these indicators reflecting their different characteristics, overall developments in inflation expectations since the introduction of QQE can be broadly divided into the following three phases. The first phase is the period after the introduction of QQE through summer 2014. In this period, indicators of inflation expectations rose clearly. The introduction of QQE appears to have had a significant impact on inflation expectations. The second phase is from summer 2014 through summer 2015. During this period, many indicators of inflation expectations were largely unchanged. The fall in crude oil prices since summer 2014 and weak demand after the consumption tax hike in April 2014 seem to have pushed down inflation expectations. The Bank expanded QQE in October 2014. Thanks to this response, inflation expectations remained flat despite the strong headwinds. The third phase is the period since summer 2015 up until now. Many indicators of inflation expectations have weakened during this phase. This is attributable to the deceleration of global economic growth against the backdrop of the slowdown of emerging economies, continued volatile developments in global financial markets amid this situation, and a further decline in crude oil prices toward the beginning of 2016. The Bank introduced the negative interest rate policy in January 3 2016, but this has been insufficient to offset the negative effects of these developments amid the continued volatility in global financial markets. This interpretation of developments in inflation expectations is backed by analyses conducted by the Bank focusing on (1) the mechanism of inflation expectations formation and (2) the Phillips curve (Appendix 1 ""Division of Inflation Expectations into Phases Using Statistical Methods"" and Appendix 2 ""Examination of Inflation Expectation Dynamics""). C. The Mechanism of Inflation Expectations Formation Inflation expectations need to be raised further in order to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent. However, it should be noted that, since the observed inflation rate is likely to remain subdued for the time being, a further rise in inflation expectations through the adaptive mechanism is uncertain and may take time. This highlights the important role played by the forward-looking expectations formation mechanism. Inflation expectations can be regarded as consisting of two components: a forward-looking component shaped by the price stability target set by the central bank; and a backward-looking, or adaptive, component reflecting the observed inflation rate. If the forward-looking component is sufficiently strong, even if the observed inflation rate deviates from the price stability target -- which is 2 percent in most advanced economies -- people expect the inflation rate to revert to close to the target in due course. Therefore, the observed inflation rate will gravitate toward the target -- the expression used in this situation is that inflation expectations are ""anchored."" In Japan, as the price stability target has not yet been achieved due to the prolonged deflation, it is the adaptive component that dominates in the formation of inflation expectations (Chart 2 ""Phillips Curve: Japan and United States""). A comparison of the way inflation expectations in Japan and the United States are formed shows that in Japan the adaptive component plays a much larger role than in the United States (Appendix 3 ""The Mechanism of Inflation Expectations Formation in Advanced Economies""). 4 One of the factors underlying the adaptive nature of inflation expectations formation in Japan is that during the annual shunto (wage negotiations between workers and management in spring), wages are determined by referring to the observed inflation rate in the preceding fiscal year (Appendix 4 ""The Importance of Past Price Developments in Wage Determination""). The Bank has attempted to make expectations formation more forward-looking by pursuing QQE with the aim of anchoring inflation expectations at the price stability target of 2 percent. However, in the course of this attempt, the observed inflation rate declined due to a variety of factors such as the substantial fall in crude oil prices, and inflation expectations -- reflecting their adaptive manner -- followed suit. D. The Role of the Monetary Base in the Formation of Inflation Expectations The expansion of the monetary base, together with the commitment to achieving the price stability target and the Bank's purchases of JGBs, by bringing about a regime change in monetary policy, has transformed peoples' perceptions of inflation and has led to a rise in inflation expectations. The relationship between the monetary base and inflation expectations seems to be of a long-run rather than a short-run nature. Therefore, what is important is the Bank's commitment to expanding the monetary base in the long run. As explained above, QQE has helped to generally push up inflation expectations. This suggests that the expansion of the monetary base as part of the policy package played a role in this, in combination with the Bank's commitment to achieving the price stability target and JGB purchases. At the same time, since summer 2015, inflation expectations have weakened even though the monetary base has continued to expand. As theory suggests, this relationship between the monetary base and inflation expectations is of a long-run rather than a short-run nature. E. The Downward Effects on Nominal Long-Term Interest Rates Looking at developments in nominal long-term interest rates (10-year JGB yields) after the introduction of QQE, with the Bank carrying out large-scale purchases of JGBs, interest rates declined markedly through the end of 2014 (from about 0.7 percent to about 0.4 5 percent) and subsequently hovered in the range of about 0.3-0.4 percent until the end of 2015. Following the introduction of the negative interest rate policy in January 2016, nominal long-term interest rates again declined substantially and have recently been in negative territory (Chart 3 ""10-Year JGB Yields""). Long-term interest rates reflect factors such as the outlook for economic activity and prices as well as long-term interest rates abroad. Controlling for these factors, the Bank conducted quantitative analyses of the impact of its JGB purchases on long-term interest rates using two different approaches. The results suggest the following: (1) the Bank's JGB purchases have been effective in lowering long-term interest rates; (2) the impact of a given increase in the Bank's JGB holdings on long-term JGB yields diminished between the start of 2014 and the introduction of the negative interest rate; and (3) the negative interest rate policy has been effective in lowering long-term interest rates (Appendix 5 ""The Impact of JGB Purchases and the Negative Interest Rate Policy on Long-Term Interest Rates""). Taking also the considerations on inflation expectations in the previous sections into account, these developments in nominal interest rates can be explained as follows. First, from the start of QQE through summer 2014, the Bank's JGB purchases resulted in a clear decline in nominal interest rates. In fact, the impact of the purchases was larger than the observed decline suggests, since the decline coincided with upward pressure on nominal interest rates through the rise in inflation expectations during this period. Therefore, the impact of a given amount of JGB purchases on long-term interest rates during this period was substantial. Second, following this period, the impact of JGB purchases declined, perhaps because the Bank's remuneration rate on excess reserves (0.1 percent) worked as a floor for nominal short-term interest rates, discouraging long-term interest rates from falling below a certain level. Third, since the introduction of a negative interest rate in January 2016, the impact of the Bank's JGB purchases on long-term interest rates has strengthened again as the floor for short-term interest rates declined, since they now could go into negative territory. 6 F. Effects of the Decline in Real Interest Rates on Economic Activity and Prices As explained at the outset, the main transmission channel of QQE and ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" is to push down real interest rates and thereby produce a positive impact on economic activity and prices (Chart 4 ""Real Long-Term Interest Rates""). Changes in financial and economic indicators since the introduction of QQE can be summarized as follows. First, financial conditions have improved as evidenced by the moderate increase in bank lending and the decline in lending rates, the rise in stock prices, and the depreciation of the yen. Second, the real economy has also improved as evidenced by the decline in the unemployment rate and the narrowing output gap, which currently stands at about 0 percent, or the long-term average. Third, on the price front, the real economy, the output gap has improved to around 0 percent, which is the long-term average, and the unemployment rate has declined to around 3 percent. On the price front, the rate of change in the CPI for all items less fresh food and energy -- which shows the underlying trend in prices -- turned positive from a level of about minus 0.5 percent before the introduction of QQE and has remained in positive territory for more than two and a half years (Chart 5 ""Financial and Economic Developments after the Introduction of QQE""). To examine to what extent these changes can be attributed to the effects of the decline in real interest rates, the Bank ran counterfactual simulations using its Quarterly Japanese Economic Model (Q-JEM), a large-scale macroeconomic model of the Japanese economy. Specifically, in the counterfactual simulations, actual developments in the economy and prices were compared with simulated developments obtained assuming QQE had not been introduced and real interest rates hence had not declined. The simulation results suggest that the negative output gap in fiscal 2015 would have been between 0.6 and 4.2 percentage points larger, and the annual change in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) in fiscal 2015 would have been between about 0.3 and 1.5 percentage points lower than was actually the case. These figures indicate that there are considerable differences in the simulation results, which reflect differences in the assumptions regarding (1) exactly when QQE started having an impact on real interest rates and (2) whether, in addition to the decline in real interest rates, the depreciation of the yen and the rise in stock prices are 7 regarded as part of the effects of QQE. Nevertheless, most of the simulations suggest that Japan still would have been in deflation if QQE had not been introduced. Separately, the Bank examined why the 2 percent price stability target has not been achieved, using a vector-autoregressive (VAR) model. Specifically, the deviation of the actual path of the rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) from the median of the Policy Board members' forecasts presented in the April 2013 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report) was decomposed into various factors. The deviation in the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2015 from the forecast is minus 1.9 percentage points (the difference between the forecast of 1.9 percent and the actual result of 0.0 percent). About half of the deviation (minus 1.0 percentage point) can be attributed to the decline in crude oil prices, while the remainder can be explained by the output gap (minus 0.3 percentage point) as well as factors specific to inflation (minus 0.7 percentage point). These results are consistent with the findings in Sections II-B and II-C that inflation expectations turned out to be lower than forecasted by the Bank due to the adaptive nature of expectations formation was a major reason why the 2 percent target has been missed (Appendix 6 ""Assessment of the Policy Effects Based on Macroeconomic Models""). III. The Effects and Impact of the Negative Interest Rate A. The Effects of the Negative Interest Rate The negative interest rate policy introduced by the Bank in January 2016, in combination with JGB purchases, has pushed down not only short-term but also long-term interest rates substantially. This shows that the combination of these policy measures is an effective means for the central bank to exert influence on the entire yield curve. ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" lowers the short end of the yield curve by applying a negative interest rate to a portion of current account balances (namely, marginal increases in such balances) held by financial institutions at the Bank, and in combination with JGB purchases, exerts further downward pressure on interest rates across the entire yield curve. Developments since the introduction of this policy measure shows that interest rates have fallen substantially across the entire yield curve; moreover, the yield curve has flattened in 8 such a way that the extent of the decline in interest rates was larger for longer maturities (Chart 6 ""Changes in the JGB Yield Curve""). The mechanism underlying these developments is as follows. First, the application of a negative interest rate to current account balances that financial institutions hold at the Bank has led to a decline in short-term interest rates. Second, in addition, it has reduced the incentive for financial institutions to sell their holdings of JGBs and thereby increase their current account balances, and with the Bank's JGB purchases compressing risk premiums, long-term interest rates have been pushed down. And third, as a result of financial institutions' ""search for positive yield,"" it has increased the demand for assets with a positive interest rate, considerably driving down super-long-term JGB yields. This mechanism likely is responsible for the flattening of the yield curve. The quantitative analysis in Appendix 5 suggests that the negative interest rate policy pushed down long-term interest rates by about 0.2-0.3 percent. In addition, the panel data analysis in Appendix 5 suggests that the downward effect of monetary easing measures on long-term interest rates has strengthened since the adoption of a negative interest rate and that this strengthening has been more pronounced for longer maturities. This means that the introduction of a negative interest rate has contributed to the flattening of the yield curve. B. Developments in the Natural Rate of Interest The basic mechanism of monetary easing -- regardless of whether it is conducted through conventional or unconventional policy means -- consists of driving the real interest rate below the natural rate of interest, which is the real interest rate at which economic activity and prices neither accelerate nor decelerate. Japan's natural rate of interest has followed a downward trend reflecting the deceleration in the potential growth rate and other factors. While the natural rate of interest is not easy to estimate, a number of calculations suggest that it is around 0 percent (Chart 7 ""Indicators Regarding Natural Rate of Interest""). Under ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate,"" real interest rates are currently at levels well below the natural rate of interest, so that Japan's financial conditions can be judged to be highly accommodative. At the same time, it is also 9 essential to raise the natural rate of interest by undertaking structural reform initiatives and measures to strengthen Japan's growth potential (Appendix 7 ""The Concept and Estimation of the Natural Rate of Interest""). C. The Pass-Through of ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" to Lending Rates and Other Interest Rates The decline in JGB yields has translated into a decline in lending rates as well as interest rates on corporate bonds and CP. Financial institutions' lending attitudes continue to be proactive. Thus, so far, financial conditions have become more accommodative under the negative interest rate policy. However, because the decline in lending rates has been brought about by reducing financial institutions' lending margins, the extent to which a further decline in the yield curve will lead to a decline in lending rates depends on financial institutions' lending stance going forward. Before the introduction of the negative interest rate policy, it had been argued that a further decline in risk-free yields (i.e., JGB yields) might not lead to a corresponding decline in banks' lending rates or interest rates on corporate bonds and CP, since there was little room for interest rates on deposits -- financial institutions' main source of funding -- to fall. However, since the introduction of a negative interest rate, lending rates as well as interest rates on corporate bonds and CP have fallen significantly, each marking new historic lows (Chart 8 ""Lending, Corporate Bond, CP, and Deposit Rates""). In fact, the pass-through from the decline in the policy interest rate to these funding rates has been roughly similar to that in previous episodes of policy interest rate cuts (Chart 9 ""The Pass-Through Rate of Lending and Other Interest Rates in Phases of Policy Interest Rate Cuts""). These developments show that the negative interest rate policy has led to a steady decline in lending rates as well as interest rates on corporate bonds and CP. Given that the decline in deposit rates has been smaller than the decline in lending rates, the decline in lending rates, however, has come at the expense of financial institutions' lending margins. Therefore, the extent to which a further decline in interest rates translates into a 10 reduction in lending rates will also depend on financial institutions' lending stance going forward. Moreover, reflecting financial institutions' search for positive yield, new developments have been observed in the field of corporate finance such as an increase in the issuance of super-long-term corporate bonds and in funding through long-term subordinated loans (Chart 10 ""Issuance of Super-Long-Term Corporate Bonds""). D. The Term Structure of Interest Rates and the Impact on Economic Activity and Prices The impact of interest rates on economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions depends on the shape of the yield curve. In this regard, the following three points warrant attention. First, short- and medium-term interest rates have a larger impact on economic activity than longer-term rates. Second, the link between the impact of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve may change as firms explore new ways of raising funds such as issuing super-long-term corporate bonds under the current monetary easing, including the negative interest rate policy. Third, an excessive decline and flattening of the yield curve may have a negative impact on economic activity by leading to a deterioration in people's sentiment, as it can cause uncertainty about the sustainability of financial functioning in a broader sense. A decline in real interest rates has a positive impact on economic activity and prices. However, the degree of this impact differs depending on the maturity of interest rates. In general, a decline in short- to medium-term interest rates produces a larger impact in terms of stimulating economic activity and prices. The reason is that short- to medium-term funds account for a large part of borrowing by firms and households. The Bank examined the extent to which a decline in real interest rates of different maturities leads to an improvement in the output gap by employing the concept of the ""natural yield curve,"" which applies the concept of the natural rate of interest not to the interest rate at a certain maturity but across the entire yield curve. The results of this analysis indicate that the improvement in the output gap brought about by a unit decline in the real interest rate at 11 each maturity tranche was largest at maturities of 1-2 years but gradually became smaller the longer the maturity (Appendix 8 ""The Effect of the Yield Curve Gap on the Output Gap""). It should be noted, however, that the results of this analysis are based on the assumption that existing financial structures remain unchanged. Should financial structures change as a result of the environment of unprecedentedly low interest rates -- and the increase in the issuance of super-long-term corporate bonds could be a sign of such change -- this may lead to changes in the relationship between the shape of the yield curve and the economic impact of changes in real interest rates. E. The Impact on the Functioning of Financial Intermediation Regarding liquidity in and the functioning of the JGB market, many liquidity indicators suggest that there has been a decline in liquidity in the JGB market since the introduction of ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate."" Given that the Bank's large-scale JGB purchases aim to lower interest rates by compressing term premiums, the impact on liquidity is a necessary consequence of the intended effect of JGB purchases. Moreover, so far, the Bank has faced no specific difficulties in carrying out JGB purchases. However, as the Bank will continue with unprecedentedly large-scale JGB purchases, it will continue to carefully monitor developments in liquidity in and the functioning of the JGB market (Chart 11 "" Liquidity Indicators in the JGB Markets""). In addition, if the negative interest rate were to excessively reduce financial institutions' profits (deposit-taking institutions such as banks), this would make them more reluctant to lend or lead them to impose higher lending rates so as to cover the costs associated with negative interest rates, which would potentially weaken their functioning as financial intermediaries. Generally speaking, since (1) financial institutions' basic business model consists of raising short-term funds and investing in long-term assets and (2) interest rates on deposits, which are the main funding tools, rarely become negative, the flattening of the yield curve at a low level reduces the spread between deposit and lending rates, with negative consequences for financial institutions' profits. The impact of a negative interest rate on financial institutions' profits is particularly large in Japan's case, since the amount 12 outstanding of deposits far exceeds that of lending and credit spreads on loans are already extremely small, reflecting long-standing competition among financial institutions. Moreover, given that the impact on financial institutions' profits has a cumulative effect on their financial soundness, what also matters is how long the policy continues (Appendix 9 ""The Impact of the Negative Interest Rate on Financial Institutions' Profits""). In addition, it should be noted that financial institutions can boost their profits by selling assets they hold to realize valuation gains, which tend to increase when interest rates fall and the yield curve flattens. On the other hand, when interest rates rise and the yield curve steepens, financial institutions would suffer valuation losses. So far, however, surveys such as the Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan (Tankan) and the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices at Large Japanese Banks (Loan Survey) suggest that financial institutions' lending attitudes continue to be proactive and financial conditions, as shown by the decline in lending rates, have been more accommodative. Therefore, there is no evidence that financial institutions' functioning as intermediaries has been impaired (Chart 12 ""Lending Attitudes as Perceived by Firms and Financial Institutions""). Another issue is that an excessive decline in interest rates -- especially at the long and super-long end -- lowers the rates of return on insurance and pension products, and increases firms' pension benefit obligations. The direct impact of this on economic activity as a whole is unlikely to be substantial. However, attention needs to be paid to the possibility that it can cause uncertainty regarding the sustainability of financial functioning in a broader sense, with a negative impact on economic activity through a deterioration in people's sentiment (Chart 13 ""Life and Pension Insurances under Negative Interest Rates""). 13 Appendixes Appendix 1: Division of Inflation Expectations into Phases Using Statistical Methods Appendix 2: Examination of Inflation Expectation Dynamics Appendix 3: The Mechanism of Inflation Expectations Formation in Advanced Economies Appendix 4: The Importance of Past Price Developments in Wage Determination Appendix 5: The Impact of JGB Purchases and the Negative Interest Rate Policy on Long-Term Interest Rates Appendix 6: Assessment of the Policy Effects Based on Macroeconomic Models Appendix 7: The Concept and Estimation of the Natural Rate of Interest Appendix 8: The Effect of the Yield Curve Gap on the Output Gap Appendix 9: The Impact of the Negative Interest Rate on Financial Institutions' Profits Appendix 1: Division of Inflation Expectations into Phases Using Statistical Methods Developments in various indicators of inflation expectations in the more than three years since the introduction of QQE can be broadly divided into three phases: (1) a clear rise in all indicators through summer 2014; (2) a period in which, from summer 2014 through summer 2015, they remained largely flat; (3) and a subsequent weakening since then (Appendix Chart 1 [1]). However, different indicators of inflation expectations all move in slightly different ways, so that the exact timing of the three phases differs somewhat depending on which of the indicators one focuses on. Therefore, the exact timing of the three phases is examined using principal component analysis. Principal component analysis is a technique that makes use of common factors that are extracted from multiple indicators. In this particular case, ""synthesized inflation expectations indicators"" were built based on the first principal component extracted from separate indicators of households', firms', and experts' (economists' and market participants') inflation expectations. With regard to experts' inflation expectations, several indicators were used. Developments in the synthesized inflation expectations indicators can be regarded as capturing the common trend in the inflation expectations of the three different groups of economic agents (i.e., households, firms, and experts). These new indicators make it possible to more objectively determine the timing of the different phases. Looking at developments in the synthesized inflation expectations indicators, these increased in Phase 1 (from April 2013 through summer 2014), remained largely flat in Phase 2 (from summer 2014 through summer 2015), and have weakened in Phase 3 (since summer 2015). The principal component analysis therefore provides support for the timing of the division into the three phases in the main text of this comprehensive assessment (Appendix Chart 1 [2]). 1 Appendix 2: Examination of Inflation Expectation Dynamics The underlying trend in Japan's inflation has improved steadily since the introduction of QQE. However, the price stability target of 2 percent has not been achieved. To examine why, this appendix presents a decomposition of the deviation of the observed inflation rate from the price stability target into several factors based on the following model. Model Specification and Three Types of Shocks The model consists of a system of three equations, in which (1) the observed inflation rate (measured in terms of the CPI for all items less fresh food and energy) depends on the output gap and short-term inflation expectations (Phillips curve), (2) short-term inflation expectations depend on the observed inflation rate in the previous period and medium- to long-term inflation expectations (the mechanism of inflation expectations formation), and (3) medium- to long-term inflation expectations depend on the price stability target set by the central bank and medium- to long-term inflation expectations in the previous period. Note that the residuals in equations (1) to (3) above represent shocks to (a) the observed inflation rate, (b) inflation expectations, and (c) the credibility of the price stability target, respectively. The deviation of the observed inflation rate from the price stability target of 2 percent can be decomposed into the following three shocks (Appendix Chart 2 [1]).1 (a) Observed inflation rate shocks: These are calculated as the deviations of the observed inflation rates from the Phillips curve. These deviations include short-term fluctuations in the observed inflation rate as well as the impact of developments in the real economy on the observed inflation rate not fully captured by the output gap. (b) Inflation expectations shocks: These are calculated as deviations of short-term inflation expectations from the relationship determining short-term inflation expectations. Such deviations include discontinuous changes in inflation expectations caused by a switch in 1 Both short-term (1 year ahead) and medium- to long-term inflation expectations (6-10 years ahead) are taken from the Consensus Forecasts and represent economists' inflation expectations. Short-term inflation expectations are adjusted to exclude the estimated effects of the change in the consumption tax rate. 2 the monetary policy regime, the effects of exchange rate movements that potentially have a persistent effect on prices, and second-round effects caused by energy price fluctuations. (c) Price stability target credibility shocks: These are shocks that cause medium- to long-term inflation expectations to deviate from the price stability target. In contrast to the United States, where medium- to long-term inflation expectations are anchored, in Japan anchoring of inflation expectations to the price stability target of 2 percent is still in progress. Consequently, credibility shocks are negative throughout the observation period. Decomposition Results The decomposition results for each of the three phases identified in Appendix 1 can be summarized as follows (Appendix Chart 2 [2]).2 Phase 1: From April 2013 onward, Japan experienced a clear positive shock to inflation expectations, which suggests that the introduction of QQE provided a positive shock pushing up inflation expectations. Furthermore, the negative output gap, which had previously been putting downward pressure on prices, shrank to around 0 percent. A possible interpretation is that the decline in real interest rates brought about by the introduction of QQE led to an improvement in the output gap. Reflecting these developments, the deviation of the observed inflation rate from the price stability target narrowed steadily. Phase 2: The positive effect of the shock to inflation expectations witnessed in Phase 1 diminished over time. The additional positive effect of improvements in the output gap on the observed inflation rate disappeared. These developments can be regarded as reflecting the effects of the slowdown of Japan's economy, which was partly due to the consumption tax hike in April 2014. Moreover, the size of the negative observed inflation rate shocks 2 It should be noted that, as a result of the revision of the base year for the CPI from 2005 to 2010 (which resulted in a downward revision of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI for all items less fresh food and energy for 2011 of 0.7 percentage point), the decomposition results for 2011 overestimate the negative observed inflation rate shock and the positive inflation expectations shock. 3 increased, which suggests that, as a result of weaker private consumption, downward pressure on prices was greater than can be explained by changes in the output gap. However, due to the expansion of QQE in October 2014, inflation expectations shocks became clearly positive again, which helped to offset the negative shocks. Consequently, the deviation from the price stability target of 2 percent remained almost flat in Phase 2. Phase 3: Since summer 2015, with global stock prices declining partly as a result of the slowdown in emerging economies, the yen has appreciated against major currencies, while crude oil prices declined further toward the beginning of 2016. Against this backdrop, inflation expectations shocks have become negative. This suggests that inflation expectations have been pushed down by the second-round effects of the fall in crude oil prices and the world-wide decrease in inflation expectations and that these negative effects have not yet been offset by the introduction of ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" in January 2016. In this situation, the deviation of the observed inflation rate from the price stability target of 2 percent has been gradually widening. 4 Appendix 3: The Mechanism of Inflation Expectations Formation in Advanced Economies Inflation expectations are formed through a combination of two components: a forward-looking component shaped by the price stability target set by the central bank; and a backward-looking, or adaptive, component reflecting the observed inflation rate. This appendix provides a comparison of inflation expectations formation across major advanced economies. For the comparison, short-term inflation expectations (1-year ahead expectations in the Consensus Forecasts) were regressed on the observed inflation rate and medium- to long-term inflation expectations (6-10 years ahead expectations in the Consensus Forecasts). In addition, medium- to long-term inflation expectations were regressed on the observed inflation rate and the central bank price stability target (2 percent). The estimation results show that in Japan, the observed inflation rate accounts for around 70 percent of short-term inflation expectations and close to 40 percent of medium- to long-term expectations. The adaptive component plays a considerably larger role in Japan than in the United States, the euro area, and the United Kingdom in the formation of both short-term and medium- to long-term inflation expectations (Appendix Chart 3). 5 Appendix 4: The Importance of Past Price Developments in Wage Determination A possible explanation for the fact that Japan's inflation expectations are greatly influenced by adaptive expectations formation is that, in comparison with the United States and Europe, wage negotiations in Japan such as those between workers and management in spring -- the annual shunto -- are more affected by developments in the observed inflation rate, including developments in energy prices. This appendix presents the estimation results of a simple hybrid wage Phillips curve for Japan, the United States, and Germany, in which changes in nominal negotiated wages are regressed on the following three variables: medium- to long-term inflation expectations; the past inflation rate; and the unemployment rate gap. The results indicate the following: (1) for the Unites States and Germany, the coefficients on medium- to long-term inflation expectations (α1 in Appendix Chart 4 [1]) are quite large, while the coefficients on the past inflation rate (1-α1) are only weakly significant or insignificant; on the other hand, (2) for Japan, the coefficients on both medium- to long-term inflation expectations and the past inflation rate are significant, and the latter is larger than the former, indicating that the past inflation rate has a somewhat larger impact on changes in wages than inflation expectations. Since the end of 2014, headline inflation in all three countries has fallen substantially as a result of the decline in crude oil prices (Appendix Chart 4 [2]). Yet, while the decline in the observed inflation rate due to the decline in crude oil prices has exerted clear downward pressure on base pay increases in Japan, the impact on wages in the United States and Germany has been limited (Appendix Chart 4 [3]). This difference is partly due to the fact that negotiated wages in the United States and Germany apply for longer than in Japan, so that medium-term inflation tends to be taken into account in the wage negotiations in these countries, with the inflation target set by the central bank serving as an important reference (Appendix Chart 4 [4]). (see Box 2 in the July 2016 Outlook Report) 6 Appendix 5: The Impact of JGB Purchases and the Negative Interest Rate Policy on Long-Term Interest Rates In order to examine the extent to which the Bank's JGB purchases and the negative interest rate policy reduced long-term interest rates, two types of analyses based on different approaches have been conducted. Specifically, the first approach is to regress 10-year JGB yields on the share of JGBs outstanding held by the Bank and other variables, while the second consists of a panel regression in which the effect of the Bank's JGB purchases on JGB yields at each maturity is measured as the residual. Approach 1: Regression Using the Bank's JGB Holdings as Explanatory Variable Long-term (10-year) JGB yields were regressed on three different variables: the share of the Bank's JGB holdings in the total amount of JGBs outstanding; long-term U.S. Treasury bond yields (10 years); and forecasts of Japan's economic growth rate (Appendix Chart 5-1). The results show that (1) increases in the Bank's share of JGB holdings had a statistically significant downward impact on long-term JGB yields, and (2) declines in long-term JGB yields not explained by the explanatory variables (i.e., where the estimated residuals take a negative value) became larger for some time after the introduction of QQE, then gradually became smaller, and eventually turned positive in the spring of 2015. The latter finding suggests that the impact of a given increase in the Bank's JGB holdings on long-term JGB yields may have diminished during the observation period. To examine this issue, another regression was conducted in which the coefficient on the Bank's share of JGB holdings, by including a dummy variable, was allowed to change. The results suggest that the effectiveness of the Bank's JGB purchases most likely declined in early 2014.3 Taking the estimation results of the model in which the dummy variable takes a value of one from April 2014 onward, the downward effect of a 10 trillion yen increase in the Bank's JGB holdings on long-term JGB yields was minus 6.9 bps until March 2014 and minus 0.6 bps from April 2014 onward (Appendix Chart 5-2). 3 For example, in terms of the adjusted R-squared, the best fit is obtained when the dummy takes a value of one from sometime between January and April 2014 onward. 7 Following the introduction of the negative interest rate policy in January 2016, long-term JGB yields have again fallen by a larger margin. Regression analysis using a dummy variable representing the negative interest rate policy and assuming that the impact of a given increase in the Bank's JGB holdings on long-term JGB yields remained unchanged from the preceding period indicates that the negative interest rate policy pushed down long-term JGB yields by 23 bps. Approach 2: Panel Regression for JGB Yields of Different Maturities The second approach consists of a panel analysis regressing various long-term JGB yields (2, 5, 10, and 20 years) on the following three variables: long-term U.S. Treasury bond yields (10 years); the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food); and the active job openings-to-applicants ratio, which is used as a proxy for the output gap. In this regression, the effect of the Bank's JGB purchases is regarded to be represented by the residual, since it is not incorporated as an explanatory variable in the regression equation. Developments in the estimated residuals show that (1) the effect of the Bank's JGB purchases was substantial just after the introduction of QQE but subsequently temporarily waned; (2) the downward effect on long-term JGB yields increased considerably again after the introduction of the negative interest rate policy; and (3) this downward effect was larger for longer maturities and such tendency was remarkable especially during the period after the introduction of the negative interest rate policy (Appendix Chart 5-3). Finally, the residual following the introduction of the negative interest policy is estimated to have widened by 24 bps in the case of 10-year JGB yields, which is in line with the estimation results of Approach 1 above in terms of the size of the estimated effect of the negative interest rate policy. 8 Appendix 6: Assessment of the Policy Effects Based on Macroeconomic Models To assess the impact of policies since the introduction of QQE on Japan's economic activity and prices, this appendix presents (1) a simulation exercise based on the Bank's large-scale macroeconomic model (Q-JEM) and (2) an analysis of the background of the unexpected slowdown in CPI inflation based on a VAR model.4 Simulation Exercise Based on the Bank of Japan's Macroeconomic Model (Q-JEM) QQE and ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" likely affected Japan's economic activity and prices mainly through the decline in real interest rates as a result of the decline in nominal interest rates and the rise in inflation expectations. In this appendix, counterfactual simulations are carried out to compute how the output gap and the rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) would have evolved under the hypothetical scenario that real interest rates (nominal interest rates minus inflation expectations) remained unchanged following the introduction of QQE. The difference between the simulation results and the actual data for the output gap and CPI inflation is regarded as the policy effect.5 4 Q-JEM is a large-scale macroeconomic model with more than 200 variables that are important for analyzing Japan's economy, including real variables, financial variables, and indicators of expectations. Equations are estimated based on historical data for Japan. For details, see Fukunaga et al., ""The Quarterly Japanese Economic Model (Q-JEM): 2011 version,"" Bank of Japan Working Paper Series, No. 11-E-11, 2011. 5 In Bank of Japan Monetary Affairs Department, ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing: Assessment of Its Effects in the Two Years since Its Introduction,"" Bank of Japan Review Series, No. 15-E-3, 2015 (referred to ""Assessment after Two Years"" hereafter), the policy effects over the two years after the introduction of QQE were estimated by calculating the change in real interest rates and multiplying this by the interest-rate multipliers in Q-JEM. While conceptually the approach employed in this appendix is similar to the one used in the ""Assessment after Two Years,"" the simulations here are conducted from the opposite perspective. The ""Assessment after Two Years"" estimated the impact of the decline in real interest rates on economic activity and prices. In contrast, the analysis in this appendix estimates how the economy and prices would have evolved if real interest rates had not declined. The reason why the latter approach is used is that it can better estimate the policy effects, since developments in inflation expectations have been more complex than those observed at the time of the ""Assessment after Two Years."" In the ""Assessment after Two Years,"" it was assumed that the impact of the decline in real interest rates was instantaneous with the introduction of QQE. On the other hand, in the analysis here, the impact of changes in real interest rates is assumed to affect the economy gradually. For this reason, the policy effects estimated here tend to be smaller than that based on the approach in the ""Assessment after Two Years,"" even when the same period is examined. 9 In the simulation exercise, two different alternatives are considered regarding (1) when the Bank's policies introduced in early 2013 started to affect the macroeconomy, and (2) whether only the decline in real interest rates or also the substantial depreciation of the yen and rise in stock prices are regarded as part of the policy effects. This means that four different simulations are conducted. With respect to point (1), in the first scenario, the policy effects are measured in terms of changes in variables from the April-June quarter of 2013, which is when the Bank actually introduced QQE. In the second scenario, the impact is measured in terms of changes in variables from the January-March quarter of 2013. The rationale for the second scenario is to include the impact of the introduction of the price stability target in January 2013, which had led to a rise in inflation expectations already before the introduction of QQE in April 2013. With respect to point (2), the first scenario regards only the decline in real interest rates as part of the policy effects, while the second scenario also includes the substantial depreciation of the yen and rise in stock prices as part of the policy effects. The reason for the latter scenario is that even though a decline in real interest rates in Q-JEM leads to some yen depreciation and rise in stock prices through the mechanisms in the model, the actually observed changes in these variables have been much larger than those generated in the model. The simulation results (Appendix Chart 6-1) indicate that in all scenarios, the negative output gap would have been larger than actually was the case. This suggests that without the decline in real interest rates, depreciation of the yen, and rise in stock prices brought about by QQE and ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate,"" the output gap until recently would have been clearly negative. The size of the policy effect on the output gap differs across the four simulations, ranging from 0.6 to 4.2 percentage points for fiscal 2015. The simulation results also indicate that in all scenarios, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) would have been lower than actually was the case, with the policy effect ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 percentage points for fiscal 2015. Although the simulation results differ considerably depending on the extent to which developments are regarded as policy effects, it is clear that QQE and ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" have had a positive impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. Specifically, in three of the four scenarios, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all 10 items less fresh food and energy) would until recently have been negative or close to zero percent, meaning that Japan's economy would have still been, or even still be, in deflation without QQE. VAR Analysis of the Unexpected Slowdown of CPI Inflation The above simulations suggest that QQE and ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" have had a substantial positive impact on economic activity and prices. Nevertheless, even though three years have passed since the introduction of QQE, the 2 percent price stability target has not been achieved. To examine why the 2 percent price stability target has not been achieved, a VAR model is used. Specifically, the deviation of the actual path of the rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) from the Policy Board members' median forecast in the April 2013 Outlook Report is decomposed into various factors. In this analysis, a VAR model consisting of (1) the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food), (2) the output gap, (3) the nominal effective exchange rate, and (4) crude oil prices is estimated using two sets of data: the Policy Board members' forecasts for these four variables when QQE was introduced; and actual data for these variables. Forecasted and actual rate of changes in the CPI are then decomposed respectively into the contribution of the forecasted and actual output gap, the nominal effective exchange rate, and crude oil prices and the two decompositions compared (Appendix Chart 6-2). Note that in estimating the VAR model based on the Policy Board members' forecasts, their projections of crude oil prices and the nominal effective exchange rate are assumed to be constant from the April-June quarter of 2013. Furthermore, the Policy Board members' forecasts for the output gap and the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI in the April 2013 Outlook Report, which are on a fiscal year basis, have been converted into quarterly data using statistical techniques such as linear interpolation. The results show that of the deviation in the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) for fiscal 2015 from the original forecast of minus 1.9 percentage points (the difference between the forecast of 1.9 percent and the actual result of 0.0 percent), about half (minus 1.0 percentage point) can be attributed to the decline in crude oil prices (measured in terms of the real West Texas Intermediate crude oil price). Of the 11 remainder, 0.3 percentage point can be explained by the output gap and 0.7 percentage point by factors specific to inflation. The latter represent changes in inflation that are not explained by crude oil prices, the nominal effective exchange rate, and the output gap, and likely mainly reflect changes in inflation expectations. 12 Appendix 7: The Concept and Estimation of the Natural Rate of Interest The natural (or neutral) rate of interest is the real interest rate level at which economic activity and prices neither accelerate nor decelerate. From a theoretical perspective, the natural rate of interest can also be defined as the real interest rate which balances savings and investment under full employment. Under certain conditions, the natural rate of interest in the long run coincides with the potential growth rate, which is why the potential growth rate is often considered to be a good long-run approximation of the natural rate of interest. Estimates by the Bank suggest that Japan's potential growth rate currently is in the range of 0.0-0.5 percent. Recent forecasts by firms and economists put Japan's long-term growth rate at around 1 percent (Chart 7 [1]). However, since in the short run the natural rate of interest is influenced by factors such as the business cycle, it is desirable to estimate it taking such factors into account. Existing estimation approaches can be broadly divided into two types. The first consists of smoothing out time series data of the real interest rate. The second consists of estimating the natural rate of interest using time series data of a broad range of macroeconomic variables such as the real interest rate, the inflation rate, and the output gap, taking the structural relationships between these variables into account. A representative example of the first type is the approach using the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter. A representative example of the second type is the approach developed by Laubach and Williams (2003), two Federal Reserve economists.6 The latter approach estimates the output gap and the natural rate of interest simultaneously using the Kalman filter, taking the IS curve and the Phillips curve as given. The estimation of the natural yield curve by Imakubo, Kojima, and Nakajima (2015, see Appendix 8) employs a similar approach. 7 The first type of approach is easier implement, but estimates are greatly affected by actual movements in the real interest rate. 6 Thomas Laubach and John C. Williams, ""Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,"" Review of Economics and Statistics, 85 (4), 2003, pp. 1063-1070. 7 Kei Imakubo, Haruki Kojima and Jouchi Nakajima, ""The natural yield curve: its concept and measurement,"" Bank of Japan Working Paper Series, No. 15-E-5, 2015. See also Kei Imakubo, Haruki Kojima and Jouchi Nakajima, ""The natural yield curve: its concept and developments in Japan,"" Bank of Japan Research Laboratory Series, No. 15-E-3, 2015. 13 The second type of approach has the advantage that it is based on theoretical foundations regarding the natural rate of interest. Employing these various estimation approaches, the results indicate that Japan's natural rate of interest estimated employing the approaches by Laubach and Williams and by Imakubo, Kojima, and Nakajima has been around 0 percent since 2010 (Chart 7 [2]). On the other hand, in the estimation using the HP filter, the natural rate of interest stood at more than 1 percent around 2010 but subsequently declined sharply and recently reached around minus 1 percent. The results based on the HP filter estimation appear to be greatly affected by the fact that real interest rates have substantially declined since the introduction of QQE. Given that estimates of the natural rate of interest differ depending on the estimation approach, they need to be treated with a degree of caution; however, the estimation results suggest that it is likely that Japan's natural rate of interest currently is at a low level of around 0 percent. 14 Appendix 8: The Effect of the Yield Curve Gap on the Output Gap QQE and ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" have been exerting downward pressure on the entire yield curve. In order to evaluate the effects of monetary policy on the entire yield curve, it is necessary to examine not only the natural rate of interest (the real interest rate at which the economy and prices neither accelerate nor decelerate) at a specific short maturity, but also the natural yield curve -- that is, the yield curve composed of the natural rates of interest over all maturities (Appendix Chart 8-1 [1]). In this appendix, the effects of lowering the yield curve on the economy (the output gap) are analyzed employing an approach previously published by Imakubo, Kojima, and Nakajima (2015), staff of the Bank of Japan.8 Decomposing the Yield Curve into Three Components While interest rates at different maturities evolve in a complex manner, it is possible to gain a general impression of changes along the entire yield curve employing a comparatively simple approach. For instance, using the Nelson-Siegel model, one can roughly describe changes in the yield curve in terms of three components: (1) the level (a parallel downward shift); (2) the slope (a steepening of the slope as a result of a decline in short-term interest rates); and (3) the curvature (a decline in medium-term yields, resulting in a crescent-shaped curve) (Appendix Chart 8-1 [2] and [3]). Estimating the impact on the output gap of a 1 percentage point increase in each of the three components using data up to the January-March quarter of 2016, when ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" was introduced, shows that changes in the level have the largest effect on the output gap (minus 0.20 percentage point), followed by the slope effect (minus 0.12 percentage point), and the curvature effect (minus 0.04 percentage point) (Appendix Chart 8-2 [1]). 8 See footnote 7 in Appendix 7. 15 Coefficient on the Yield Curve Gap for Each Maturity Assuming a specific probability distribution, it is possible to determine the effects of a change in the yield curve gap -- that is, the gap between the actual and natural yield curves -- at different maturities on the output gap.9 Appendix Chart 8-2 (2) shows the coefficient estimates on the yield curve gap at different maturities. The results indicate that the absolute values of the coefficient estimates are largest for short maturities of 1-2 years but then gradually diminish as maturities increase, implying that decreases in short- and medium-term yields have larger monetary easing effects than decreases in long- and super-long-term yields. This finding is consistent with the fact that the amounts of liabilities such as bank loans, corporate bonds, and CP by the renewal period of interest rate concentrates at the short and medium maturities (Appendix Chart 8-2 [3]). It should be noted, however, that the results of this analysis are based on the assumption that existing financial structures remain unchanged. Should financial structures change as a result of the environment of unprecedentedly low interest rates -- and the increase in the issuance of super-long-term corporate bonds could be a sign of such change -- this may lead to changes in the relationship between the shape of the yield curve and the economic impact of changes in real interest rates. 9 While the results presented here are based on the specific assumption that the probability distribution follows a Beta mixture distribution, the results remain largely unchanged if an alternative distribution such as a step distribution is assumed instead. 16 Appendix 9: The Impact of the Negative Interest Rate on Financial Institutions' Profits The major transmission channels through which the decline in interest rates due to the adoption of the negative interest rate affects the profits of financial institutions are the compression of the spread between deposit and lending rates and the deterioration in the profitability of bond investments. The reason for the compression of the spread between deposit and lending rates is that Japanese banks have a structural surplus of deposits over loans, and while there is little room for deposit rates to decline, lending rates are falling (Appendix Chart 9-1). Lending rates decline through the following three mechanisms. (1) For loans whose interest rate is linked to market interest rates, lending rates decline immediately as the base rate for those loans declines. For instance, in the case of loans linked to TIBOR, which make up the majority of loans linked to market interest rates in Japan, the base rate (i.e., TIBOR) has declined by around 10bps since the introduction of the negative interest rate. (2) In the case of long-term loans with a fixed interest rate, lower interest rates are applied when loans are rolled over at maturity. Given the current average duration of loans, which is about 3-4 years, about 30 percent of loans are replaced by new loans at a lower interest rate each year. If loans are refinanced before they mature, the pace of decline in lending rates will be faster. (3) Lending rates also decline as credit spreads on new loans narrow as a result of competition among financial institutions. Two factors play a role. The first is the trend decline in lending rates on the back of long-standing competition among financial institutions. The second factor, discussed in more detail below, is the deterioration in the profitability of bond investments due to the negative interest rate, which further increases competition in lending. 17 Comparing types of financial institutions, it is likely that major banks are more affected by (1) above, since they have relatively large exposures in the form of loans linked to market interest rates. On the other hand, in the case of regional banks and shinkin banks, it is likely that (2) and (3) have a relatively large impact on lending rates (Appendix Chart 9-2). The reason for the deterioration in the profitability of financial institutions' bond investments is that once a bond they hold matures and is redeemed, the reinvestment return on those funds will fall under the current interest rate environment. The average duration of major banks' bond holdings is about 3-4 years, while that of regional banks and shinkin banks is about 4-6 years. Of course, the unrealized gains on bond portfolios will increase as interest rates decline. Reflecting the three mechanisms through which lending rates decline, the impact of monetary easing measures on financial institutions' profits will depend on the following: (1) the extent to which the decline in risk-free interest rates (i.e., JGB yields) pushes down base rates for loans and long-term lending rates; (2) the extent of the compression of credit spreads through competition (in this context, it is necessary to take into account not only the impact of the negative interest rate, but also the trend before its introduction); and (3) the outstanding amount and maturity structure of each type of loan extended by individual financial institutions as well as the amount and maturity structure of their bond holdings and unrealized gains. These factors will need to be taken into account when assessing the impact on financial institutions' profits. Looking at the latest financial results (for the April-June quarter of 2016) of banks in aggregate (major banks and regional banks, on a non-consolidated basis), their net income was 780.2 billion yen, which is a decline of about 28 percent from the same period last year (1,076.3 billion yen) (Appendix Chart 9-2). Apart from the impact of the negative interest rate, this decline also reflects the fall in stock prices and the appreciation of the yen during the period. A breakdown of the decline in net income shows that net interest income decreased by 301.5 billion yen, realized gains on stockholdings decreased by 136.5 billion yen, and net fees and commissions (e.g., fees and commissions for the sale of investment trusts) fell by 30.7 billion yen. Looking at the decline in net interest income in more detail, 18 in addition to the compression of the spread between deposit and lending rates and the deterioration in the profitability of bond investments following the introduction of the negative interest rate, factors include a decline in profits due to the cancellation of investment trusts on the back of the decline in the stock prices, a decline in profits from revenues denominated in foreign currencies due to the appreciation of the yen, and an increase in foreign currency funding costs. It should be noted, however, that the impact of the negative interest rate on financial institutions' profits was only starting to be reflected in the financial results for the April-June quarter of 2016. The Bank will continue to carefully examine and explain the possible effects of monetary easing measures on the profits of financial institutions and the potential impact on the functioning of financial intermediation through publications such as the Financial System Report. 19 Charts 1.

"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/mpr_2016/k160921a.pdf"," Bank of Japan New Framework for Strengthening Monetary Easing: ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing with Yield Curve Control"" 1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan conducted a comprehensive assessment of the developments in economic activity and prices under ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE)"" and ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" as well as their policy effects, and compiled ""The Bank's View"" as provided in Attachment 1. The Policy Board's view on the current situation of and outlook for economic activity and prices is provided in Attachment 2. 2. Based on these, with a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time, the Bank decided to introduce ""QQE with Yield Curve Control"" by strengthening the two previous policy frameworks mentioned above. The new policy framework consists of two major components: the first is ""yield curve control"" in which the Bank will control short-term and long-term interest rates; and the second is an ""inflation-overshooting commitment"" in which the Bank commits itself to expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index (CPI) exceeds the price stability target of 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. Specifically, the Bank decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control a) Guideline for market operations (by a 7-2 majority vote)[Note 1] The guideline for market operations specifies a short-term policy interest rate and a target level of a long-term interest rate. The Bank decided to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. The Bank will cut the interest rates further if judged necessary. The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. 1 The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain more or less at the current level (around zero percent). With regard to the amount of JGBs to be purchased, the Bank will conduct purchases more or less in line with the current pace -- an annual pace of increase in the amount outstanding of its JGB holdings at about 80 trillion yen -- aiming to achieve the target level of a long-term interest rate specified by the guideline. JGBs with a wide range of maturities will continue to be eligible for purchase, while the guideline for average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be abolished. b) New tools of market operations for facilitating yield curve control (by an 8-1 majority vote)[Note 2] The Bank decided to introduce the following new tools of market operations so as to control the yield curve smoothly. (i) Outright purchases of JGBs with yields designated by the Bank (fixed-rate purchase operations)1 (ii) Fixed-rate funds-supplying operations for a period of up to 10 years (extending the longest maturity of the operation from 1 year at present) (2) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases except for JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to set the following guidelines.[Note 3] a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively. 1 In case of a spike in interest rates, the Bank stands ready to conduct fixed-rate JGB purchase operations -- for example, those with regard to 10-year and 20-year JGB yields -- in order to prevent the yield curve from deviating substantially from the current levels. 2 (3) Inflation-overshooting commitment[Note 4] The Bank will continue with ""QQE with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds the price stability target of 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. Meanwhile, the pace of increase in the monetary base may fluctuate in the short run under market operations which aim at controlling the yield curve. With the Bank maintaining this stance, the ratio of the monetary base to nominal GDP in Japan is expected to exceed 100 percent (about 500 trillion yen) in slightly over one year (at present, about 80 percent in Japan compared with about 20 percent in the United States and the euro area). The Bank will make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. 3. In light of the findings of the comprehensive assessment, the thinking behind the newly introduced policy framework is as follows. (1) Background to the introduction of yield curve control As shown in the comprehensive assessment, QQE has brought about improvements in economic activity and prices mainly through the decline in real interest rates, and Japan's economy is no longer in deflation, which is commonly defined as a sustained decline in prices. With this in mind, ""yield curve control,"" in which the Bank will seek for the decline in real interest rates by controlling short-term and long-term interest rates, would be placed at the core of the new policy framework. The experience so far with the negative interest rate policy shows that a combination of the negative interest rate on current account balances at the Bank and JGB purchases is effective for yield curve control. In addition, the Bank decided to introduce new tools of market operations which will facilitate smooth implementation of yield curve control. 3 (2) Measures to raise inflation expectations The price stability target of 2 percent has not been achieved. In the course of the Bank's attempt to raise inflation expectations toward 2 percent, observed inflation rates declined due to a variety of exogenous factors such as a fall in crude oil prices. Under these circumstances, inflation expectations declined, as the adaptive mechanism has been playing a relatively large role in the formation of inflation expectations in Japan. This seems to be the main factor that hampers achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. In order to address this situation, the Bank judged it necessary to adopt measures that will raise inflation expectations in a more forceful manner. First, the Bank decided to adopt a commitment that allows inflation to overshoot the price stability target so as to strengthen the ""forward-looking mechanism"" in the formation of inflation expectations. Achieving the price stability target means attaining a situation where the inflation rate is 2 percent on average over the business cycle. Given the fact that both observed and expected inflation rates are below 2 percent currently, the Bank judged it appropriate to enhance the credibility for the price stability target among the public by committing itself to ""expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI exceeds the price stability target of 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner."" Second, it is necessary to have momentum in order to shift peoples' deflationary mindset which had been entrenched amid the prolonged period of deflation. Thus, the Bank adheres to its commitment to achieving the 2 percent inflation ""at the earliest possible time."" Meanwhile, a further rise in inflation expectations through the adaptive mechanism is uncertain and may take time. Considering these, the Bank judged it appropriate to adopt a new policy framework with the mechanisms for yield curve control placed at the core that enables the Bank to make more flexible adjustments according to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions and that enhances the sustainability of monetary easing. (3) Possible options for additional easing With regard to possible options for additional easing, the Bank can cut the short-term policy interest rate and the target level of a long-term interest rate, which are two key benchmark rates for yield curve control. It is also possible for the Bank to expand asset 4 purchases as has been the case since the introduction of QQE. Moreover, if the situation warrants it, an acceleration of expansion of the monetary base may also be an option. 4. In January 2013, the Government and the Bank released the joint statement, which sets out that both parties strengthen their policy coordination and work together in order to overcome deflation early and achieve sustainable economic growth with price stability. The Bank will pursue ""QQE with Yield Curve Control"" and achieve the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time. The Bank believes that its monetary policy and the Government's fiscal policy as well as initiatives for strengthening Japan's growth potential will produce synergy effects, and thereby will navigate Japan's economy toward overcoming deflation and achieving sustainable growth.[Note 4] [Note 1] ",2016-09-21,"2016-09"

Japan's economy has continued its moderate recovery trend. Overseas economies have continued to grow at a moderate pace, although emerging economies remain sluggish in part. In this situation, exports have picked up. On the domestic demand side, business fixed 1 investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have been at high levels and business sentiment has improved somewhat. Against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation, private consumption has been resilient, and housing investment has continued its pick-up. In the meantime, public investment has been more or less flat. Reflecting these moderate increases in demand both at home and abroad and the progress in inventory adjustments, industrial production has picked up. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been slightly negative. Inflation expectations have remained in a weakening phase. 3. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to turn to a moderate expansion. Domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, on the back of highly accommodative financial conditions and fiscal spending through the government's large-scale stimulus measures. Exports are expected to follow a moderate increasing trend on the back of an improvement in overseas economies. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be slightly negative or about 0 percent for the time being, due to the effects of the decline in energy prices, and as the output gap improves and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rise, it is expected to increase toward 2 percent. [Note 3] 4. Risks to the outlook include the following: developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies, particularly China; developments in the U.S. economy and the impact of its monetary policy on global financial markets; the consequences stemming from the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union (EU) and their effects; prospects regarding the European debt problem, including the financial sector; and geopolitical risks. 5.

Japan's economy is expanding moderately, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating. Overseas economies have continued to grow firmly on the whole. In this situation, exports have been on an increasing trend. On the domestic demand side, business fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend with corporate profits and business sentiment improving. Private consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations, against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation. Housing investment has been weakening somewhat. Meanwhile, public investment has been more or less flat, remaining at a relatively high level. Reflecting these increases in demand both at home and abroad, industrial production has been on an increasing trend, and labor market conditions have continued to tighten steadily. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is around 1 percent. Inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue its moderate expansion. Domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, on the back of highly accommodative financial conditions and underpinnings through the government's past stimulus measures. Exports are expected to continue their moderate increasing trend on the back of the firm growth in overseas economies. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to continue on an uptrend and increase toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of an improvement in the output gap and a rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. [Note 2] Risks to the outlook include the following: the U.S. economic policies and their impact on global financial markets; developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies; negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU) and their effects; and geopolitical risks.

Japan's economy is expanding moderately, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating, and labor market conditions have continued to tighten steadily. Meanwhile, prices have continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the economic and employment conditions. As shown in the July 2018 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report) released today, this is attributable to a combination of factors such as firms' cautious wage- and price-setting stance and households' continuous cautiousness toward price rises, and it is likely to take more time than expected to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent. However, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent with the output gap remaining positive. Based on the above recognition, the Bank judged it appropriate to introduce forward guidance for policy rates and to enhance the sustainability of ""QQE with Yield Curve Control"" by conducting market operations as well as asset purchases in a more flexible manner, thereby maintaining the output gap as long as possible within positive territory. The Bank recognizes that this will lead to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time, while securing stability in economic and financial conditions. The Bank will continue with ""QQE with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will examine the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target.

With a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time, Mr. G. Kataoka dissented, considering that it was appropriate for the Bank to make a commitment to taking additional easing measures if it revised downward its assessment of medium- to long-term inflation expectations, rather than to make the commitment to maintaining the levels of short- and long-term interest rates.

Japan's economy is likely to continue on a moderate expanding trend, despite being affected by the slowdown in overseas economies for the time being. Although the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) has continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the economic expansion and the labor market tightening, it is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly due to the output gap remaining positive. However, there are high uncertainties regarding the outlook for economic activity and prices including developments in overseas economies. In addition, it is likely to still take time to achieve the price stability target. Based on the above recognition, the Bank decided to make clearer its stance to persistently continue with powerful monetary easing while examining uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including the effects of the scheduled consumption tax hike and developments in overseas economies. Also, the Bank judged it appropriate to take such measures as the expansion of eligible collateral for the Bank's provision of credit, thereby contributing to smooth implementation of fund-provisioning and asset purchases as well as to securing market functioning. By continuing with powerful monetary easing and thereby maintaining the output gap within positive territory, the Bank will aim to achieve the price stability target at the earliest possible time, while securing stability in economic and financial conditions. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will examine the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target. (Attachment) Expanding eligible collateral for the Bank's provision of credit
(1) The Bank will relax the eligibility standards concerning creditworthiness regarding debt of companies based on the following principal policy.

(1) Yield curve control

The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period.[Note 1]

The short-term policy interest rate:
The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank.
The long-term interest rate:
The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. While doing so, the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices.1 With regard to the amount of JGBs to be purchased, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen.
(2) Guidelines for asset purchases

With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines.

a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner, the Bank may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions.
b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively. (1) Yield curve control

Japan's economy has been on a moderate expanding trend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating, although exports and production have been affected by the slowdown in overseas economies. Overseas economies have been growing moderately on the whole, although slowdowns have been observed. In this situation, exports and industrial production have shown some weakness. On the other hand, corporate profits and business sentiment have stayed at favorable levels on the whole, albeit with some weakness observed in part, and business fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend. Private consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations, against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation. Housing investment has been more or less flat. Public investment also has been more or less flat, remaining at a relatively high level. Meanwhile, labor market conditions have continued to tighten steadily. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. Inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue on a moderate expanding trend, despite being affected by the slowdown in overseas economies for the time being. Domestic demand is expected to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, mainly against the background of highly accommodative financial conditions and the underpinnings through government spending. Although exports are projected to show some weakness for the time being, they are expected to be on a moderate increasing trend on the back of overseas economies growing moderately on the whole. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of the output gap remaining positive and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rising. [Note 2] Risks to the outlook include the following: the U.S. macroeconomic policies and their impact on global financial markets; the consequences of protectionist moves and their effects; developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies such as China, including the effects of the two aforementioned factors; developments in global adjustments in IT-related goods; negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU) and their effects; and geopolitical risks. Downside risks concerning overseas economies are likely to be significant, and it also is necessary to pay close attention to their impact on firms' and households' sentiment in Japan. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. As for policy rates, the Bank intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time, at least through around spring 2020, taking into account uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including developments in overseas economies and the effects of the scheduled consumption tax hike. It will examine the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target.

With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner, the Bank may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions. b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively. Japan's economy has been on a moderate expanding trend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating, although exports, production, and business sentiment have shown some weakness, mainly affected by the slowdown in overseas economies and natural disasters. Overseas economies have been growing moderately on the whole, although slowdowns have continued to be observed. In this situation, exports have continued to show some weakness, and industrial production has declined recently, due partly to the effects of natural disasters. On the other hand, with corporate profits staying at high levels on the whole, business fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend. Private consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations due to such effects as of the consumption tax hike, against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation. Housing investment has been more or less flat, and public investment has increased moderately. Meanwhile, labor market conditions have remained tight. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is at around 0.5 percent. Inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue on a moderate expanding trend, as the impact of the slowdown in overseas economies on domestic demand is expected to be limited, although the economy is likely to continue to be affected by the slowdown for the time being. Domestic demand is expected to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, mainly against the background of highly accommodative financial conditions and active government spending, despite being affected by such factors as the consumption tax hike. Although exports are projected to continue showing some weakness for the time being, they are expected to be on a moderate increasing trend on the back of overseas economies growing moderately on the whole. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of the output gap remaining positive and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rising, despite such effects as of the decline in crude oil prices for the time being. [Note 2] Risks to the outlook include the following: the consequences of protectionist moves and their effects; developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies such as China; developments in global adjustments in IT-related goods; developments in the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU) and their effects; geopolitical risks; and developments in global financial markets under these circumstances. Downside risks concerning overseas economies seem to remain significant, and it also is necessary to pay close attention to their impact on firms' and households' sentiment in Japan. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. As for the policy rates, the Bank expects short- and long-term interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels as long as it is necessary to pay close attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost. It will examine the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target. In particular, in a situation where downside risks to economic activity and prices, mainly regarding developments in overseas economies, are significant, the Bank will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost.

Although policy responses taken by the government and the Bank of Japan have been exerting some positive effects, financial conditions have been less accommodative in terms of corporate financing, as seen in deterioration in firms' financial positions. Given these developments, the Bank judged it appropriate to further enhance monetary easing through (1) an increase in purchases of CP and corporate bonds, (2) strengthening of the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), and (3) further active purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and treasury discount bills (T-Bills). The Bank will take these measures with a view to doing its utmost to ensure smooth financing, such as of financial institutions and firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. To this end, at the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held today, the Policy Board of the Bank decided upon the following.
(1) Increase in purchases of CP and corporate bonds

The Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to significantly increase the maximum amount of additional purchases of CP and corporate bonds and conduct purchases with the upper limit of the amount outstanding of about 20 trillion yen in total.1 In addition, the maximum amounts outstanding of a single issuer's CP and corporate bonds to be purchased will be raised substantially, and the maximum remaining maturity of corporate bonds to be purchased will be extended to 5 years (see Attachment).

(2) Strengthening of the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)

With regard to the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Corporate Financing regarding the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), which was introduced and became effective in March, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to (1) expand the range of eligible collateral to private debt in general, including household debt (from about 8 trillion yen to about 23 trillion yen as of end-March 2020), (2) increase the number of eligible counterparties (to mainly include member financial institutions of central organizations of financial cooperatives), and (3) apply a positive interest rate of 0.1 percent to the outstanding balances of current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank that correspond to the amounts outstanding of loans provided through this operation.2 The Bank decided to strengthen this operation with a view to firmly supporting financial institutions to further fulfill the functioning of financial intermediation for a wide range of private sectors, mainly in terms of firms. This operation has been renamed to the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).

In addition, with the aim of further supporting financing mainly of small and medium-sized firms, the chairman instructed the staff to swiftly consider a new measure to provide funds to financial institutions, taking account, for example, of the government's programs to support financing such as those in its emergency economic measures, and report back at a later MPM (see Attachment for the outline of the measure).

(3) Further active purchases of JGBs and T-Bills

In a situation where the liquidity in the bond market remains low, the increase in the amount of issuance of JGBs and T-Bills in response to the government's emergency economic measures will have an impact on the market.

The Bank already has implemented the following two measures to support financing mainly of firms: (1) purchases of CP and corporate bonds (maximum amount outstanding: about 20 trillion yen) and (2) the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (fund-provisioning against private debt pledged as collateral: about 25 trillion yen <as of end-April>). Today, as a third measure, a new fund-provisioning measure was introduced (fund-provisioning against eligible loans such as interest-free and unsecured loans made by eligible counterparties based on the government's emergency economic measures: about 30 trillion yen). The Bank will refer to these three measures as the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (the Special Program: total size of about 75 trillion yen). The Policy Board decided, by a unanimous vote, to extend the duration of these measures by 6 months and continue to conduct them until the end of March 2021. 3. In addition, with a view to maintaining stability in financial markets, the Bank has been providing ample yen and foreign currency funds without setting upper limits mainly through purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and the conduct of the U.S. dollar funds- supplying operations, and has been actively purchasing exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs). 4. By conducting these measures, the Bank will continue to support financing mainly of firms and to maintain stability in financial markets. On this basis, it will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 for the time being and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary. 1 Attachment New Fund-Provisioning Measure 1. Overview The Bank will provide funds to eligible counterparties against pooled collateral for up to 1 year at the loan rate of 0 percent with the maximum amounts outstanding of eligible loans reported by those counterparties. 2. Eligible Loans (1) Loans based on the government's programs Interest-free and unsecured loans based on the government's emergency economic measures and loans guaranteed by the credit guarantee corporations in response to COVID-19 (2) Loans equivalent to 2. (1) Loans to small and medium-sized firms affected by COVID-19 which are equivalent to 2. (1) in terms of loan conditions (the maximum amount for each eligible counterparty: 100 billion yen) 3. Addition to the Macro Add-on Balances Twice as much as the amounts outstanding of the loans will be included in the Macro Add-on Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. 4. Application of a Positive Interest Rate to Current Account Balances A positive interest rate of 0.1 percent will be applied to the outstanding balances of current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank corresponding to the amounts outstanding of loans provided through this measure. 5. Eligible Counterparties Member financial institutions of central organizations of financial cooperatives will also be included. 2 6. Timing of Implementation The Bank's fund-provisioning through this measure will start in June, taking into account loans made by financial institutions as of end-May. 7. Others This measure and the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) will be conducted in an integrated manner. 3",2020-05-22,"2020-05"

(1) Yield curve control

The Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 1]

The short-term policy interest rate:
The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank.
The long-term interest rate:
The Bank will purchase a necessary amount of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. While doing so, the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices. 1
(2) Guidelines for asset purchases

With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines.

a) The Bank will actively purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) for the time being so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces with the upper limit of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively. 2

Japan's economy has been in an extremely severe situation due to the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) at home and abroad. Overseas economies have been depressed significantly, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this situation, exports and industrial production have declined substantially. Corporate profits and business sentiment have deteriorated, and the deceleration in the pace of increase in business fixed investment has become evident. With the continuing impact of COVID-19, the employment and income situation has shown some weakness, and private consumption has decreased significantly, mainly in services such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations. Housing investment has declined moderately. Meanwhile, public investment has increased moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole but less so in terms of corporate financing, as seen in deterioration in firms' financial positions. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is at around 0 percent, mainly affected by the decline in crude oil prices. As for inflation expectations, relatively weak indicators have been observed. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to remain in a severe situation for the time being due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad, although economic activity is expected to resume gradually. Thereafter, as the impact of COVID-19 subsides, the economy is likely to improve, supported by accommodative financial conditions and the government's economic measures, as well as through the expected materialization of pent-up demand and a projected recovery in production from the decline brought about by COVID-19. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be negative for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19 and the decline in crude oil prices. Thereafter, with the economy improving, the rate of change is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually. With regard to risks to the outlook, there have been extremely high uncertainties over the consequences of COVID-19 and the magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies. In addition, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner.
The Bank will continue to support financing mainly of firms and maintain stability in financial markets through (1) the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), (2) an ample provision of yen and foreign currency funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing JGBs and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) active purchases of ETFs and J-REITs.
For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels. [Note 2] [Note 1] ",2020-06-16,"2020-06"

While doing so, the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices. 2 (2) Purchases of ETFs and J-REITs (a unanimous vote)

The Bank will actively purchase ETFs and J-REITs for the time being so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces with the upper limit of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively. 3 The Bank will actively purchase ETFs and J-REITs for the time being so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces with the upper limit of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively. 3 The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner.
The Bank will continue to support financing mainly of firms and maintain stability in financial markets through (1) the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), (2) an ample provision of yen and foreign currency funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing JGBs and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) active purchases of ETFs and J-REITs.
For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels. [Note 2] Given that economic activity and prices are projected to remain under downward pressure for a prolonged period due to the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will conduct an assessment for further effective and sustainable monetary easing, with a view to supporting the economy and thereby achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. In doing so, since the framework of ""QQE with Yield Curve Control"" has been working well to date, the Bank judges that there is no need to change it. The Bank will assess various measures conducted under this framework and make public its findings, likely at the March 2021 MPM. [Note 1] ",2020-12-18,"2020-12"

Based on the findings, the Bank judged that the following basic stance on monetary policy was important: with a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, the Bank will continue with monetary easing in a sustainable manner and make nimble and effective responses without hesitation to counter changes in developments in economic activity and prices, as well as in financial conditions. In this regard, the Bank will take the following actions. (1) With a view to enabling the Bank to cut short- and long-term interest rates nimbly while considering the impact on the functioning of financial intermediation, the Bank will establish the Interest Scheme to Promote Lending. In this scheme, interest rates, which will be linked to the short-term policy interest rate, will be applied to a certain amount of financial institutions' current account balances (see Attachment 2). (2) In order to conduct yield curve control flexibly during normal times, the Bank will make clear that the range of 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield fluctuations would be between around plus and minus 0.25 percent from the target level. At the same time, it will introduce ""fixed-rate purchase operations for consecutive days"" as a powerful tool to set an upper limit on interest rates when necessary.

Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and regions. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase steadily. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment have improved on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained weak due to the impact of COVID-19. Private consumption has been stagnant due to strong downward pressure on consumption of services, such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations. Housing investment has stopped declining. Public investment has continued to increase moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has been seen. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been at around 0 percent recently due to a rise in energy prices, despite being affected by COVID-19 and a reduction in mobile phone charges. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. Although the level of Japan's economic activity, mainly in the face-to-face services sector, is expected to be lower than that prior to the pandemic for the time being, the economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually and supported by an increase in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures. Thereafter, as the impact subsides, it is projected to continue growing with a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifying. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be at around 0 percent in the short run. Thereafter, it is expected to increase gradually, mainly on the back of continued improvement in economic activity, the rise in energy prices, and a dissipation of the effects of the reduction in mobile phone charges. With regard to risks to the outlook, there have been high uncertainties over the consequences of COVID-19 and their impact on domestic and overseas economies. In addition, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. The Bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner.

The Bank will continue to support financing mainly of firms and maintain stability in financial markets through (1) the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), (2) an ample provision of yen and foreign currency funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing JGBs and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) purchases of ETFs and J-REITs with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding.

[Note 3] Climate change issues could exert an extremely large impact on developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions from a medium- to long-term perspective. The Bank considers that supporting the private sector's efforts on the issues from a central bank's standpoint will contribute to stabilizing the macroeconomy in the long run. In taking actions from the monetary policy side, the Bank deems it important to give consideration to market neutrality. Against this background, in order to support private financial institutions' various efforts in the field related to climate change, the Bank judged it appropriate to introduce a new fund-provisioning measure, through which it provides funds to financial institutions for investment or loans that they make to address climate change issues based on their own decisions. This new measure will be a successor to the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth.

The Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, on the details of the Funds-Supplying Operations to Support Financing for Climate Change Responses (Climate Response Financing Operations), of which the preliminary outline was made public at the previous MPM. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) at home and abroad. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and regions. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase despite some exports and production having been affected by supply-side constraints. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment have continued to improve on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained weak due to the impact of COVID-19. Private consumption has remained stagnant due to continuing strong downward pressure on consumption of services, such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations. Housing investment has picked up. Public investment has continued on a moderate uptrend. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has been seen. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been at around 0 percent, mainly due to a rise in energy prices, despite being affected by COVID-19 and a reduction in mobile phone charges. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. Although the level of Japan's economic activity, mainly in the face-to-face services sector, is expected to be lower than that prior to the pandemic for the time being, the economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually, mainly due to progress with vaccinations, and supported by an increase in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures. Thereafter, as the impact subsides, it is projected to continue growing with a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifying. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to turn slightly positive, mainly reflecting the rise in energy prices. Thereafter, it is expected to increase gradually, mainly on the back of continued improvement in economic activity and a dissipation of the effects of the reduction in mobile phone charges. With regard to risks to the outlook, there have been high uncertainties over the consequences of COVID-19 and their impact on domestic and overseas economies. In addition, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. The Bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner.

The Bank will continue to support financing mainly of firms and maintain stability in financial markets through (1) the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), (2) an ample provision of yen and foreign currency funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing JGBs and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) purchases of ETFs and J-REITs with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding.

For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

With regard to financial conditions surrounding large firms, issuance conditions for CP and corporate bonds have been favorable, and precautionary demand for liquidity has subsided in the loan market. Regarding small and medium-sized firms, their financial positions have been on an improving trend on the whole, but weakness has remained in some segments, such as the face-to-face services industry. Given these developments, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, decided to extend the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in part by six months until the end of September 2022, with a view to continuing to support financing, mainly of small and medium-sized firms. The details of the decisions are as follows.
(1) Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (a unanimous vote)
a) Regarding the fund-provisioning against loans that financial institutions make on their own (""non-government-supported loans"") in response to COVID-19, mainly to small and medium-sized firms, the Bank will extend the implementation period by six months under the current terms and conditions.
b) Regarding the fund-provisioning against loans that financial institutions make on the back of government support (""government-supported loans"") in response to COVID-19, mainly to small and medium-sized firms, the Bank will extend the implementation period by six months under the revised terms and conditions. Specifically, from April 2022 onward, this fund-provisioning will fall under Category III in the Interest Scheme to Promote Lending, for which the applied interest rate is 0 percent, and the amount to be added to the Macro Add-on Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank will be the amount outstanding of funds they receive. In accordance with the revised terms and conditions, the Bank will continue to provide funds to financial institutions against government-supported loans they make.
c) The Bank will complete the fund-provisioning against private debt pledged as collateral, which mainly consists of debt issued by large firms and housing loans, at the end of March 2022 as scheduled.
(2) Purchases of CP and corporate bonds

The Bank will complete its additional purchases of CP and corporate bonds at the end of March 2022 as scheduled. From April 2022 onward, it will purchase about the same amount of CP and corporate bonds as prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, so that the amounts outstanding of these assets will decrease gradually to the pre-pandemic levels, namely, about 2 trillion yen for CP and about 3 trillion yen for corporate bonds.

With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) as necessary with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding. b) The Bank will purchase CP and corporate bonds with an upper limit on the amount outstanding of about 20 trillion yen in total until the end of March 2022.

Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although some weakness has been seen in part, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and regions. However, in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, global financial and capital markets have been volatile and prices of commodities such as crude oil have risen significantly, and future developments warrant attention. In this situation, Japan's exports and industrial production have continued to increase as a trend, despite the remaining effects of supply-side constraints. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment have continued to improve on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained relatively weak on the whole, although improvement has been seen in some parts. A pick-up in private consumption has paused due to increased downward pressure stemming from a resurgence of COVID-19, particularly on services consumption. Housing investment has been more or less flat. Public investment has been relatively weak, albeit at a high level. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food), despite being affected by a reduction in mobile phone charges, has been at around 0.5 percent, reflecting price rises of energy and other items. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have risen moderately. Japan's economy, although expected to be affected by a rise in commodity prices, is likely to recover, with downward pressure stemming from COVID-19 on services consumption and the effects of supply-side constraints waning and with support from an increase in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increase clearly in positive territory for the time being due to a significant rise in energy prices, a pass-through of raw material cost increases, and dissipation of the effects of the reduction in mobile phone charges. Meanwhile, the underlying inflationary pressure is projected to increase, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and a rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Concerning risks to the outlook, the course of COVID-19, including variants, and its impact on domestic and overseas economies continue to warrant attention. In addition, there are extremely high uncertainties over how the situation surrounding Ukraine will affect Japan's economic activity and prices, mainly through developments in global financial and capital markets, commodity prices, and overseas economies. The Bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner.

The Bank will continue to support financing mainly of firms and maintain stability in financial markets through (1) the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), (2) an ample provision of yen and foreign currency funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing JGBs and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) purchases of ETFs and J-REITs with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding.

For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be at around 2 percent for the time being due to the impact of rises in energy and food prices, but it is expected to decelerate thereafter because the positive contribution of the rise in energy prices to the CPI is likely to wane.

(2) Guidelines for asset purchases (a unanimous vote)

With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided to set the following guidelines.

a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) as necessary with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding.
b) The Bank will purchase CP and corporate bonds at about the same pace as prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, so that their amounts outstanding will gradually return to pre-pandemic levels, namely, about 2 trillion yen for CP and about 3 trillion yen for corporate bonds.

Japan's economy has picked up as the resumption of economic activity has progressed while public health has been protected from COVID-19, despite being affected by factors such as a rise in commodity prices. Overseas economies have recovered moderately on the whole, but slowdowns have been observed, mainly in advanced economies. Exports and industrial production have increased as a trend, with the effects of supply-side constraints waning. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole. In this situation, business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has improved moderately on the whole, although some weakness has been seen in part. Private consumption has increased moderately, despite being affected by COVID-19. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been in the range of 2.5-3.0 percent due to rises in prices of such items as energy, food, and durable goods. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have risen. Japan's economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints waning, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from a rise in commodity prices due to factors such as the situation surrounding Ukraine. Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increase toward the end of this year due to rises in prices of such items as energy, food, and durable goods. Thereafter, the rate of increase is expected to decelerate because the contribution of such price rises to the CPI is likely to wane. Meanwhile, the underlying inflationary pressure is projected to increase on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and in wage growth. Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including the course of COVID-19 at home and abroad and its impact, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine, and developments in commodity prices and in overseas economic activity and prices. In this situation, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. The Bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner.

For the time being, while closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary; it also expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/state_2022/k221220a.htm","At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided to modify the conduct of yield curve control in order to improve market functioning and encourage a smoother formation of the entire yield curve, while maintaining accommodative financial conditions.

Since early spring this year, volatility in overseas financial and capital markets has increased and this has significantly affected these markets in Japan. The functioning of bond markets has deteriorated, particularly in terms of relative relationships among interest rates of bonds with different maturities and arbitrage relationships between spot and futures markets. Yields on Japanese government bonds (JGBs) are reference rates for corporate bond yields, bank lending rates, and other funding rates. If these market conditions persist, this could have a negative impact on financial conditions such as issuance conditions for corporate bonds. The Bank expects that the measures decided today will facilitate the transmission of monetary easing effects generated under the framework of yield curve control, such as through corporate financing. The Bank will aim to achieve the price stability target by enhancing the sustainability of monetary easing under this framework through implementing these measures.

In order to encourage the formation of a yield curve that is consistent with the above guideline for market operations, the Bank will continue with large-scale JGB purchases and make nimble responses for each maturity by increasing the amount of JGB purchases and conducting fixed-rate purchase operations. a) The Bank decided to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period.
The short-term policy interest rate:
The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank.
The long-term interest rate:
The Bank will purchase a necessary amount of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. b) Conduct of yield curve control

(2) Guidelines for asset purchases (a unanimous vote)

With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided to set the following guidelines.

a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) as necessary with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding.
b) The Bank will maintain the amount outstanding of CP at about 2 trillion yen. It will purchase corporate bonds at about the same pace as prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, so that their amount outstanding will gradually return to the pre-pandemic level of about 3 trillion yen. In adjusting the amount outstanding of corporate bonds, the Bank will give due consideration to their issuance conditions. With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) as necessary with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding. b) The Bank will maintain the amount outstanding of CP at about 2 trillion yen. It will purchase corporate bonds at about the same pace as prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, so that their amount outstanding will gradually return to the pre-pandemic level of about 3 trillion yen. In adjusting the amount outstanding of corporate bonds, the Bank will give due consideration to their issuance conditions. Japan's economy, despite being affected by factors such as high commodity prices, has picked up as the resumption of economic activity has progressed while public health has been protected from COVID-19. The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Although exports and industrial production have been affected by the developments in overseas economies, they have been more or less flat, supported by a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. With corporate profits being at high levels on the whole, business fixed investment has increased moderately. The employment and income situation has improved moderately on the whole. Private consumption, despite being affected by price rises, has increased moderately, with the impact of COVID-19 waning. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been at around 4 percent due to rises in prices of such items as energy, food, and durable goods. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have risen. Japan's economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints waning, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from high commodity prices and slowdowns in overseas economies. Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to decelerate toward the middle of fiscal 2023 due to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures and to a waning of the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by a rise in import prices. Thereafter, the rate of increase is projected to accelerate again moderately on the back of improvement in the output gap, rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and in wage growth, and a waning of the effects of the economic measures pushing down energy prices toward the middle of fiscal 2023. Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including the following: developments in overseas economic activity and prices; developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine and in commodity prices; and the course of COVID-19 at home and abroad and its impact. In this situation, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. The Bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner.

For the time being, while closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary; it also expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

There are extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economic activity and prices, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices, developments in commodity prices, and domestic firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices.

Japan's recent inflation rates, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI), are higher than projected in the April 2023 Outlook Report, and wage growth has risen, partly on the back of this year's annual spring labor-management wage negotiations. Signs of change have been seen in firms' wage- and price-setting behavior, and inflation expectations have shown some upward movements again. If upward movements in prices continue, the effects of monetary easing will strengthen through a decline in real interest rates, while on the other hand, strictly capping long-term interest rates could affect the functioning of bond markets and the volatility in other financial markets. Such effects are expected to be mitigated by conducting yield curve control with greater flexibility.

Meanwhile, there are also significant downside risks to Japan's economic activity and prices, including the impact of a tightening of global financial conditions on overseas economies. If such downside risks materialize, the effects of monetary easing will be maintained through a decline in long-term interest rates under the framework of yield curve control.

With extremely high uncertainties surrounding economies and financial markets at home and abroad, the Bank will patiently continue with monetary easing while nimbly responding to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions. By doing so, it will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in a sustainable and stable manner, accompanied by wage increases.

The Bank will continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to maintain the stability of financing, mainly of firms, and financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary.

"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmdeci/state_2023/k230922a.htm","At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following.
(1) Yield curve control
a) The Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period.
The short-term policy interest rate:
The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank.
The long-term interest rate:
The Bank will purchase a necessary amount of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent.
b) Conduct of yield curve control (a unanimous vote)

The Bank will continue to allow 10-year JGB yields to fluctuate in the range of around plus and minus 0.5 percentage points from the target level, while it will conduct yield curve control with greater flexibility, regarding the upper and lower bounds of the range as references, not as rigid limits, in its market operations. The Bank will offer to purchase 10-year JGBs at 1.0 percent every business day through fixed-rate purchase operations, unless it is highly likely that no bids will be submitted.1 In order to encourage the formation of a yield curve that is consistent with the above guideline for market operations, the Bank will continue with large-scale JGB purchases and make nimble responses for each maturity by, for example, increasing the amount of JGB purchases and conducting fixed-rate purchase operations and the Funds-Supplying Operations against Pooled Collateral.

(2) Guidelines for asset purchases (a unanimous vote)

With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided to set the following guidelines.

a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) as necessary with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding.
b) The Bank will maintain the amount outstanding of CP at about 2 trillion yen. It will purchase corporate bonds at about the same pace as prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, so that their amount outstanding will gradually return to the pre-pandemic level of about 3 trillion yen. In adjusting the amount outstanding of corporate bonds, the Bank will give due consideration to their issuance conditions. (1) Yield curve control

The pace of recovery in overseas economies has slowed. Although exports and industrial production have been affected by the developments in overseas economies, they have been more or less flat, supported by a waning of the effects of supply-side constraints. With corporate profits being at high levels on the whole, business fixed investment has increased moderately. The employment and income situation has improved moderately. Private consumption has increased steadily at a moderate pace, despite being affected by price rises. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has increased moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is slower than a while ago, mainly due to the effects of pushing down energy prices from the government's economic measures, but it has been at around 3 percent recently owing to the effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. Inflation expectations have shown some upward movements again. Japan's economy is likely to continue recovering moderately for the time being, supported by factors such as the materialization of pent-up demand, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from a slowdown in the pace of recovery in overseas economies. Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending gradually intensifies, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to decelerate, with a waning of the effects of the pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices. Thereafter, the rate of increase is projected to accelerate again moderately as the output gap improves and as medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage growth rise, accompanied by changes in factors such as firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Concerning risks to the outlook, there are extremely high uncertainties surrounding Japan's economic activity and prices, including developments in overseas economic activity and prices, developments in commodity prices, and domestic firms' wage- and price-setting behavior. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices.

Specifically, while the Bank will maintain the target level of 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yields at around zero percent, it will conduct yield curve control with the upper bound of 1.0 percent for these yields as a reference and will control the yields mainly through large-scale JGB purchases and nimble market operations.

The outlook for Japan's inflation rate, measured in terms of the consumer price index (CPI), has been revised upward from the July 2023Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices. This is mainly due to the prolonged effects of a pass-through to consumer prices of cost increases led by the past rise in import prices and the recent rise in crude oil prices. Toward the end of the projection period, the Bank expects that underlying CPI inflation will increase gradually toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, while this increase needs to be accompanied by an intensified virtuous cycle between wages and prices. The Bank will patiently continue with monetary easing under Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to support Japan's economic activity and thereby facilitate a favorable environment for wage increases. It will continue to closely examine developments in economic activity and prices, including the virtuous cycle between wages and prices, from the perspective of sustainable and stable achievement of the price stability target.

Meanwhile, with extremely high uncertainties surrounding economies and financial markets at home and abroad, it is appropriate for the Bank to increase the flexibility in the conduct of yield curve control, so that long-term interest rates will be formed smoothly in financial markets in response to future developments. In this regard, currently, the Bank considers that strictly capping long-term interest rates by fixed-rate purchase operations at 1.0 percent for consecutive days, which it has offered every business day in principle, will have strong positive effects, but could also entail large side effects. Given this, it decided to conduct yield curve control mainly through large-scale JGB purchases and nimble market operations.
